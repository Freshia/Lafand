the nigerian government announced friday it was suspending twitter in the country just days after twitter deleted a harmful tweet by nigerian president muhammadu buhari that suggested the state would use violence against the igbo ethnic group
despite removing the tweet the message continues to circulate on social media bringing up painful memories of a civil war that left more than one million dead
but the tweet also sparked a movement on social media in support of nigerians from the igbo ethnic group
in a series of tweets posted on june 1 2021 buhari threatened to treat nigerians from the eastern part of the country in the language they understand in a reference to nigerias 19671970 civil war against the secessionist republic of biafra in southeastern nigeria

the tweets came after a series of attacks on government and security installations in the region which have been blamed on an armed group linked to the indigenous people of biafra ipob a probiafra secessionist movement
ipob denied involvement in the attack says the voice of america

many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the nigerian civil war buharis nowdeleted tweet said

the tweets reiterated comments made by a visibly irritated buhari in the state house nigerias capital abuja about the wave of arson attacks on electoral officers
i think we have given them enough latitude
they have made their case they just wanted to destroy the country he said appearing to reference secessionist agitators 
buhari made the statement himself

the brutal civil war led to the death of over one million ethnic igbos and other easterners according to chima j
korieh a professor of african history at united states marquette university
for most nigerians the war over the breakaway state of biafra is generally regarded as an unfortunate episode best forgotten but for the igbo people who fought for secession it remains a lifedefining event asserts nigerian writer adaobi tricia nwaubani
disclosure the author is from the igbo ethnic group
twitter policy on hateful conduct prohibits tweets that promote violence or threaten people based on race ethnicity national origin
such tweets like buharis are either deleted by the tech company or the user is compelled to remove the violating content

deleted abusive tweets are still visible 
an investigation by the social media forensic expert digital africa research lab digiafricalab reveals that buharis abusive tweet is still visible across numerous timelines two days after it was deleted by twitter due to quote tweets 
over 30 hours after twitter deleted a tweet by nigerian president mbuhari for violating its rules the deleted tweet remains visible across numerous timelines due to quote tweets

signing onto different accounts through different devices digiafricalab was still able to view the more than 17000 quoted tweets made by users before the social media company pulled down the offensive tweets from the timelines of mbuhari and ngrpresident both verified twitter handles of president buhari
furthermore digiafricalab was able to click and expand president buharis deleted tweet

deleted tweets may still be visible to twitter users because twitters software also called application programming interface api relies on thirdparty applications that connect to twitter servers via a url

another reason according to j
d
biersdorfer of new york times was that deleted tweets may still be cached away and therefore available to show up in search results  until the site goes indexing again and updates itself with a fresh copy of your twitter profile and posts
backlash with iamigbotoo hashtag
president buharis abusive tweet generated a backlash from nigerian twitter users who trended the iamigbotoo hashtag to express their displeasure
in addition nigerian twitter users from different ethnic groups also adopted igbo names to show their solidarity with the igbo people

an analysis conducted on june 4 2021 by global voices on the brand mentions app revealed that in the past seven days the iamigbotoo hashtag had 508 mentions 319200 interactions 457500 reach and 313100 shares on both twitter and instagram

on march 27 a heated debate ensued on kenyan social media about utterances made onair by three radio hosts during a breakfast show
the hosts were discussing an ongoing court case involving eunice wangari a woman who was pushed off a 12floor building by a man with whom she was on a date

on twitter angered kenyans lashed out at the presenters shaffie weru joseph munoru and neville muysa for their remarks on the case of alleged genderbased violence and called out the hosts victimblaming
shaffie is insinuating that the lady who was pushed from the 12th floor of a building in nairobi cbd after she said no to a mans advancements was because she was too loose  very available hence putting herself is such a situation
homeboyz yawa
what the actual hell 
bravin yuri bravinyuri march 25 2021
the case divided online users as a section of citizens took sides with the hosts
although the trio was fired by the radio station it brought to the fore how hostile the kenyan online space has become for women
there are about 21
75 million internet users in kenya or 40 percent of the countrys population according to 2021 data by research firm datareportal
around 11 million of those use social media an increase of 2
2 percent compared to 2020
according to another report by global system for mobile communications gsma while mobile phone ownership is almost equally matched between men and women  with only five percent more men than women owning or having access to the gadget  only one in every three internet users in kenya is a woman
as an online minority women in kenya are often targets of cyberbullying
and although in 2018 the country passed a law against cyberbullying  which defines the behaviour as interacting with others in a manner that is likely to cause  apprehension or fear of violence to them or damage or loss on that persons property  with penalties of up to 10 years in prison mass online trolling still runs rampant
below well describe two other prominent cases of the past 12 months in which social media served as a platform to harass women in kenya
covid19 patient
in march 2020 brenda ivy cherotich became kenyas first covid19 patient
after fully recovering she came forth to speak about her journey just as the world was beginning to understand the new virus
but cherotich didnt receive the warm welcome she may have anticipated
after doing media interviews in april 2020 she was subjected to online harassment and backlash from kenyans on twitter or famously kot a term often used to describe the collective of active kenyans online known to rally against various causes or personalities who sought to discredit and question the truth behind her story
other online abusers poked into her personal life and her private conversations and photos were widely shared probably after being leaked by a friend or acquaintance

this stirred the itchy fingers of the keyboard warriors who had a field day on twitter trolling okwara
playing gender card everytime
women should safeguard their dignity in the first place
posing for such photos and sharing the same is equally immoral

earlier in 2021 state house spokesperson kanze dena also fell victim to kenyas cyberbullies
as she gave a press briefing to journalists at an event online abusers bodyshamed her over her weight

it quickly became a social media debate with a section of kenyans and media personalities coming to denas defense

an article by the elephant one of kenyas foremost digital publications noted that online social network spheres in kenya and globally have turned to be the frontiers for toxic expressions and harassment
there is no gainsaying that social media has become an important tool for social and professional advancement more so for women
many women have built their businesses online and in the process have learned how to connect with others
many find clients to buy and sell their products online
others find platforms to incubate ideas leading to hundreds if not millions of social enterprises that not only spur economic growth but directly empower young men and women economically
they have also learned how to improve their entrepreneurship skills online
no doubt then social media has emerged as a great space to do business
this is important for womens economic empowerment and visibility
source the elephant
it seems that for women to participate in meaningful online conversations about topics that directly affect their lives the internet must become a safer place than it is now

caribbean nations have one by one been readjusting their law books to reflect greater equity for lgbtq people by decriminalising colonialera sodomy clauses
in 2016 it was belize
two years later trinidad and tobago followed suit but the ripple effect of dismantling connected pieces of legislation has been slower in coming
three years after the court deemed the countrys buggery laws unconstitutional trinidad and tobagos equal opportunity act eoa finally looks set to amend its regulations pertaining to sexual orientation
the acts selfproclaimed purpose is to prohibit certain kinds of discrimination and promote equality of opportunity between persons of different status
to this end an equal opportunity commission and an equal opportunity tribunal were established to handle such issues but so far neither body has been unable to deal with matters of discrimination based on sexual orientation
the current laws only cover discrimination based on sex race ethnicity origin religion marital status or disability in matters of employment training education and the like
pressure to amend the current act mounted after scotiabank trinidad and tobago announced on april 14 that it would extend its health benefits to the partners of employees in samesex relationships in the same way it already offered access to the commonlaw partners of heterosexual employees
the announcement sparked a nationwide conversation and was praised by the american chamber of commerce amcham and ian roach chairman of the equal opportunity commission who noted in an interview with the trinidad and tobago newsday
it is a good move on the part of the private sector and especially by the bank who has a wide crosssection of employees
it is important that the others should follow suit past what the law insists
attorney general faris alrawi has said he is encouraged by scotiabanks inclusive initiative and remains open to doing what is necessary to address the spectrums of discrimination that exist
alrawis stance is markedly different from his position after the 2018 high court ruling soon after the unconstitutional verdict was handed down the state announced its intention to appeal
while trinidad and tobago has undeniably made great strides when it comes to discrimination for members of the local lgbtq community homophobiamuch of it rationalised on religious groundsstill exists
public reactions to scotiabanks announcement on social media networking platforms like facebook were met with lots of criticism
meanwhile lgbtq people continue to face not just discrimination but acts of violence many of them ending fatally
most recently the murder of marcus anthony singh a member of the local lgbtq community sparked online conversations about the reality that many lgbtq people face in terms of both security and discriminatory practices
many of those conversations have been happening on twitter spaces which provide an audioonly chat forum for safe discussion and education
while attorney general al rawi has not provided a timeline by which the amendments to the legislation will be tackled for the lgbtq community and its allies the hope remains that moves by private sector companies like scotiabank will soon be followed by the government eventually leading to societal change

for internet and technology companies collecting user data remains one of their main sources of income
but this business model includes a security risk for users as demonstrated by recurring cases of undisclosed commercial use massive leaks and hacking incidents
is there a credible solution for strengthening users privacy 
companies such as google and apple focus on collecting daily user data mostly via smartphones and combining information from the applications running over time the users contacts and agenda for example
a multitude of apps track the users location in real time while health and sports apps dig deep into their biometric information
this data is collected and analyzed allegedly to offer more tailored and sophisticated services
in fact most users do not realize they are offering a wealth of data to service providers and platform owners free of charge
privacy activists such as austrian max schrems have expressed strong concerns about this model
they highlight the risks of increasingly frequent privacy violations and abuses
this was perhaps best illustrated by the facebook scandal known as the cambridge analytica case  in which british consulting firm cambridge analytica obtained the personal data of 87 million facebook users without consent in order to provide analytical assistance to the 2016 presidential campaigns of ted cruz and donald trump
schrems says he warned facebook representatives about the datamining activities of cambridge analytica but could not convince them to act
they facebook representatives explicitly said that in their view by using the platform you consent to a situation where other people can install an app and gather your data
but why would you care about privacy if you have nothing to hide after all whistleblower edward snowden answered this question in a reddit discussion in 2015
arguing that you dont care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you dont care about free speech because you have nothing to say
real risks linked to the use of information technology platforms
french software engineer and data expert gaël duval has been involved for years in free software development including the mandrake linux distribution  an operating system based on a linux kernel which can legally be modified and shared with others
duval then decided to build an os that would provide smartphones users with heightened protection of their data eos
global voices spoke to him to understand how communication technology impacts lives and present both an opportunity and a risk
here is his view on the evolution of such technology 
this is a philosophical question
i personally have very mixed feelings about it because ive always been passionate about technology
but at the same time i feel that sometimes its too much and i miss the time when you had to find a phone booth to have a call
it was probably a more carefree and slowerpaced life
younger people might be surprised to know that until i was five there was no phone at home and no television
so sometimes i feel i lived a part of my life in a totally different world that doesnt exist anymore
on the other hand its really exciting to see what we can do with modern technology like having an hd video call with someone on the other side of the planet and seeing all those electric cars that at least are not burning petrol and filling our lungs with the exhaust fumes

besides the seductive dangers of nostalgia for those who still remember analog times we are also facing a real risk of dependence on information technology  a 2018 study linked behavioral problems in children with excessive use of smartphones which was shown to cause issues including attention deficit disorder add and depression
a survey published in 2020 by common sense media found that 50 percent of teenagers in the los angeles area feel dependent on their smartphones
the risk inherent in our use of such technology was recently openly acknowledged by insiders from the industry in the netflix documentary the social dilemma which includes testimonials from former employees of big tech  including google twitter and facebook  explaining how they purposefully nurtured user addiction for profit
some governments have reacted by upgrading protective legislation in order to both raise user awareness and place more responsibility on technology companies
in may 2018 the european union passed the general data protection regulation gdpr
the law adds multiple constraints to data management such as asking users for explicit authorization for the use of their data and requiring companies to remove this data after a period of three years without interaction
it also introduces extremely large fines for those who do not respect these rules
but its enforcement is limited by a lack of resources to do so among local authorities and it is of course only applicable in eu member states
a tool to empower users 
this current climate convinced duval of the need to create a tool that would allow people to take control of their own data as he explains 
our slogan is your data is your data because our personal data belongs to us and those who pretend that it shouldnt are either against freedom and democracy or they have a business that is fuelled by advertising  because personal data can help sell ads at a much higher price
this is how the os he created operates 
e is a digital ecosystem that provides a smartphone operating system that doesnt send to google any piece of your personal data like your searches your geolocation and that respects users data privacy
it doesnt look at the users data for any purpose
it also provides basic online services such as an email address some storage a calendar a way to store your contacts  everything linked with the smartphone operating system

duval said that when it comes to personal data google and apple are in the same boat  this data fuels googles business model which is essentially based on selling advertising while apple despite claiming to protect its users privacy receives an estimated 8 billion to 12 billion us dollars each year to preinstall google search on iphones and ipads
duval added 
using an iphone a user sends about 6mb of personal data to google per day
its double that amount for android users
besides apple hardware is a closed box without any transparency about whats happening inside
you have to trust them
we on the other hand support auditable privacy all the eos and the cloud software source code the recipe for building the products is opensource
it can be challenged by specialists and audited

in a context of growing dependence on smartphones it is clear that protective legislation is not enough to raise awareness and equip users with the right tools and knowledge to protect their data privacy  and this is where a digital tool that makes users more responsible and proactive can play an important role

information and awareness is important to prevent the spread of covid19

kenyas covid19 vaccination rollout has been mired by allegations of bribery line cutting and corruption that have left poor and elderly citizens waiting in long queues outside public hospitals even as the country grapples with a third wave of infections and deaths
meanwhile hundreds of wellconnected kenyans are paying anything up to 100 to secretly receive early inoculations as documented through eyewitness accounts by various kenyans online and news coverage in kenyan and international media
in early march kenya procured over 1 million doses of oxfordastrazeneca vaccine doses through the covid19 vaccines global access initiative a world health organizationbacked global vaccine distribution effort known as covax
the delivery marked the start of a campaign to offer the vaccine free of charge at select public and private hospitals
the rollout was broken down into three phases healthcare workers and security and immigration officials citizens over age 58 and adults with certain medical conditions and other citizens in vulnerable conditions such as those living in informal settlements
the country is set to receive 24 million doses through covax
it plans to vaccinate 50 percent of the population by june 2022 through a combination of covax vaccines and donations from other countries reports the washington post

in a press release unicef representative to kenya maniza zaman celebrated the arrival of the first vaccines in kenya
with the arrival of these vaccines unicef and partners are honouring the promise of the covax facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the global rollout of lifesaving vaccines she said
however this elaborately planned threephase rollout fell apart as soon as the exercise began because of a lastminute government decision to fasttrack phase two in response to the third wave conflicting politically charged interests and the states failure to consult and inform citizens
in his article questioning what is going on with kenyas covid19 vaccine drive patrick gathara a nairobibased writer and awardwinning political cartoonist noted
politicians loudly and selfservingly argued that they should be given priority to inspire confidence among the population even though the ministry of health was reporting encountering little resistance
because the state had ignored the need to explain its plan to the population there was widespread confusion about where and when people were expected to be in line
despite government directives prioritizing citizens over the age of 58 kenyan media reported that businessmen and politicians not in this age group have found a way to get the jab early exposing the countrys richpoor divide
meanwhile eligible senior citizens and poor kenyans who arent well connected and dont have money to pay a bribe often wait in line all day starting at 5 a
m
only to be asked to return the following day because the doses are finished according to the washington post
they have another door for their friends mary njoroge 58 one of the teachers told the washington post
without a godfather to help you through this process what are you supposed to do
a similar incident in another government hospital was reported by _sativa a twitter user based in nairobi kenyan
in a twitter thread he recounted the experience of his aunt a retired teacher in her 60s
while elderly people waited in line a nurse called out names and young people came to the front to get vaccinated
when his aunt asked what was happening the nurse gave her a number where she could send money he said in his twitter thread
following reports of increased enthusiasm from the public for the vaccination campaign kenyas cabinet secretary for health mutahi kagwe told the media
i think somewhere along the line we seem to have developed some confusion that anybody can walk into a vaccination centre and get vaccines
i want to make it very clear those carrying out vaccination will have to account for every dose that they have used and that dose that they have used must be matched against an eligible person
the national nurses association of kenya president alfred obengo pleaded with kenyans who are not on the priority list to avoid queuing for the vaccine
in providing clarity on how the kenyan government could have avoided this confusion in its rollout plan gathara concludes his article by saying
much of this could have been avoided if the kenyan government and its global partners including the world health organization and western governments treated kenyans as partners in the rollout rather than colonial subjects to be brutalised and exploited
sadly for kenyans their colonial state does not know how to act any differently

this article is part of uproar a small media initiative that is urging governments to address digital rights challenges at the universal periodic review upr

in early march as tanzanians began to speculate about the health and location of president john magufuli many citizens took to social media with their queries and concerns
in response the government issued threats of mass arrests to anyone who used social media to share false information about the president
authorities swiftly referred to tanzanias 2015 cybercrimes act and the 2020 electronic and postal communications online content regulations epoca to arrest and detain those who violated its rules
the government has often used cybercrime laws and online content regulations to undermine and clamp down on digital rights and freedom of expression in tanzania this time was no different
on march 17 thenvice president samia suluhu hassan revealed on state tv that john magufuli had died
soon after hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of tanzania
by then at least four people had been arrested in different parts of the country for spreading false rumors about magufulis health and location
many now wonder if tanzania will review its repressive online content regulations in a postmagufuli world or whether these laws will remain firmly in place until 2025 the remainder of magufulis term served by hassan
in early march innocent bashungwa tanzanias minister of information culture arts and sports issued a warning specifically to the media to desist from spreading rumors about magufulis whereabouts who had not been seen in the public eye since february 27
additionally the minister of legal and constitutional affairs mwigulu nchemba also threatened netizens with jail time via his twitter account for sharing nonsense rumors specifically citing section 89 of the penal code and section 16 of the cybercrimes act
police chief ramadhani kingai expressed specific interest in the twitter account of kigogo a swahili name referring to a highranking official who often exposes government wrongdoing
human rights activists have condemned these moves and the overall climate of fear created by these regulations and subsequent threats of enforcement
epoca 2020 further restrictions on digital rights
tanzania has experienced remarkable internet communications and technological advancements over the last decade
nevertheless the state often plays an influential role over tanzanian media companies and platforms and independent media lacks diversity in terms of viewpoints and representation
the internet created new spaces online for tanzanias young bloggers and social media activists to make their voices heard but the government has not welcomed this new reality
in 2010 tanzania first published the electronic and postal communications act the first of its kind in the country
by 2018 specific regulations regarding online content were released through electronic and postal communications online content regulations 2018
the government argued that these regulations were intended to monitor and regulate citizens use of social media in particular and tackle issues like hate speech and disinformation
however the regulations applied not only to mainstream media but to individual bloggers and content providers who were shocked by the new requirement to pay 900 united states dollars for a license
this includes anyone who produces livestreaming tv or radio
the sudden imposition of fees turned tanzanian social media dark as many bloggers and content providers gave up due to the exorbitant costs
opposition politicians and social media practitioners critiqued the regulations for undermining online media freedoms as well as civil society
in 2020 tanzania released revised epoca regulations issued under section 103 of the electronic and postal communication act 2010 adopted in july 2020 and announced through government gazette on government notice no
538
there are several main differences between the 2018 and 2020 versions of epoca
firstly the tanzania communications regulatory authority tcra recategorized fees with three additional subcategories under online content news  current affairs entertainment and education or religious furthering imposing restrictions on individual content providers
epoca 2020 part vi section 116
any person who provides network services without obtaining any relevant individual license commits an offense and shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of not less than 6 million tanzanian shillings  2587 united states dollars or imprisonment for a term not less than 12 months or to both

secondly the tcra expanded a more detailed list of prohibited content including among other things content that motivates or promotes phone tapping espionage data theft tracking recording or intercepting communications or conversation without right
thirdly epoca 2020 also reduced the amount of time that a licenseholder has to respond to prohibited content violations by suspending or terminating an account
under 2018 guidelines a licenseholder had 12 hours
in 2020 under part iii section 11 the response time is reduced to two hours
failure to comply within this time frame gives authorities permission to intervene either by suspending or removing an account
global voices spoke with several legal and human rights experts who have condemned epoca 2020 revisions saying it undermines both digital rights and civil society protections
they argue that these regulations further repress digital rights and deter bloggers and writers from owning their online content
the biggest problem here is that these powers contain no safeguards against abuse and with the current situation they certainly have the effect of stifling legitimate freedom of expression in tanzania said one human rights professional who asked to remain anonymous
postmagufuli the future of digital rights in tanzania
under the magufuli administration civil media and digital rights steadily declined with systematic restrictions on free speech online
in the aftermath of magufulis unexpected death many now wonder about the future of digital rights in the country  after six years of increasingly authoritarianstyle leadership
global voices spoke to several government officials on the condition of anonymity about the current regulations and whats at stake in terms of human rights in digital spaces
one human rights professional in tanzania told global voices on the condition of anonymity
the regulations are not fair as anyone can be criminalized because not many citizens understand the implications of these regulations
another suggested that the government finds social media to be an annoyance
he warned citizens to take precautions when speaking out on public platforms because the government can legally access all their details through the platform host
epoca 2020 makes it virtually impossible to remain anonymous online under regulation 9e coupled with the requirement imposed on the internet café providers to register users via recognized ids assign static ip addresses to their computers and put camera surveillance to record the activities in their premises according to this analysis by the media council of tanzania
these regulations reinforce criminal defamation restrict anonymity provide hefty punishments for violations and grant sweeping powers of content removal to the tcra and intermediaries
epoca is incompatible with internationally acceptable digital rights standards
overall these regulations stifle legitimate freedom of expression and press freedom in tanzania
yet the tanzanian government is obligated to respect and uphold rights to freedom of expression and association of all persons  including members of the media civil society and the political opposition according to tanzanias constitution as well as international and regional treaties
these rights are also essential to the exercise voting rights
tanzania is at a crossroads with digital rights
under newly swornin president hassan will the ruling revolutionary party continue to silence and repress digital rights in the country
editors note the author of this post wishes to remain anonymous due to security concerns

moving tanzania forward could not happen fast enough when president john magufuli took power in 2015

death announcement for the president of the united republic of tanzania

magufulis sudden death has however left tanzanians and others speculating about the future of politics and power in the east african nation
on friday hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of tanzania making history as tanzanias first female president the first president born on the semiautonomous islands of zanzibar and tanzanias first muslim woman serving in the top role
under tanzanias constitution hassan will serve the remainder of magufulis fiveyear term through 2025
in a short video clip widely circulated on social media hassan dismisses any doubt about her ability to lead as a woman
for those who have doubts that this woman will be able to be the president of the united republic of tanzania i would like to say to you that this person standing here is the president
applause   i would like to repeat that this person standing here is the president of the united republic of tanzania and happens to be a woman
as tanzanians mourn magufuli and process this sudden shift many have welcomed hassan

remembering magufuli
kanga honoring the late john magufuli tanzanias fifth president who died on march 17 2021
buriani baba yetu mungu akulaze pema  tutakukumbuka daima shujaa wetu in swahili or goodbye our father may god bless you  we will always remember our hero
in english
many tanzanians   and africans  are remembering magufuli on social media for both the bad and the good
the bad and the good of magufuli are equally undeniable and it means the legacy he leaves behind is complicated but also valuable
the promagufuli and antimagufuli camps will never agree and the debate will go on for years
michael mwebe michaelmwebe march 21 2021
magufuli gained popularity early on in his presidency for his strong anticorruption promise
his efforts to boost major infrastructure projects and industrialization fed into many tanzanians wishes for selfreliance after decades of international aid dependency
last april for example magufuli rejected a 10 billion loan united states dollars from china for a proposed megaport project in dar es salaam saying only a drunkard would accept these terms
this kanga promoted president magufuli ahead of last years elections
it reads uliahidi umetenda tunatushukuru in swahili or you promised you delivered we thank you in english
it illustrates magufulis achievements road construction barabara plane ndege bridges daraja and modern train reli ya kisasa

his anticorruption focus also appealed to western audiences and the media initially covered his ideas positively
to some magufuli is remembered as a true african statesman and panafrican putting africa first
others remember him as a populist president who promoted nationalism above all else

we denounced his autocratic ways populism  sneered at his unscientific bent but clearly with the man and woman on the street the fellow was quite popular

however magufuli applied an authoritarianstyle rule during which human rights and free speech increasingly suffered
over the last six years human rights watch amnesty international committee to protect journalists global voices and others have steadily tracked the deterioration of the civil and human rights protections
tanzania dropped six places on freedom houses scorecard measuring democracy and freedom between 2020 and 2021
when parliament in january 2019 debated the political parties act leading to a restriction of opposition parties it was interpreted as a bad omen when an owl entered parliament
magufulis administration often used legislation like electronic and postal communication online content epoca or the cybercrimes act to clamp down on opposition voices and public dissent
amended regulations in 2020 prohibited citizens from sharing public information that may cause public chaos or disorder and content with information about an outbreak of a deadly or contagious disease without the government approval from top officials
citizens couldnt speak about an earthquake that shook the coastal region last year let alone the pandemic that reached tanzania months later
and during the twoweek period of wild speculation about magufulis whereabouts and health status in early march at least four people were reportedly arrested for tweeting about the ill president
did he die of covid19 tho
magufuli reportedly died of heart complications  an issue for which he had been receiving treatment for 10 years
but magufulis sudden death left many wondering if he had perhaps succumbed to covid19
to many  not the least western audiences  magufuli will be remembered for his covid19 denial
tanzania did initially impose restrictions and guidelines to curb the spread of the virus but magufuli repeatedly denounced lockdowns as a greater threat to the economy than the virus
he actively rebuked international guidance on public health protocols like wearing masks social distancing and vaccines  urging citizens to use prayer and herbal remedies instead
after magufuli halted the publication of covid19 data last year in april he then insisted covid19 had been fended off by prayer
soon after he declared tanzania covid19 free
though it is impossible to say exactly how covid19 has affected tanzania it did not go away
when a new covid19 wave reemerged in january many tanzanians shared testimonies on social media of becoming ill with covid19like symptoms
knowing that it could be punishable to discuss covid19 people wrote nimonia mpya or the new pneumonia and breathing problems
but magufuli doubled down with his antivaccination stance in a speech from his home in chato on january 27
if the white man was able to come up with vaccinations he should now have found a vaccination against aids he would now have found a vaccination against tuberculosis he would now have found a vaccination against malaria he would now have found a vaccination against cancer
this was a major departure from magufulis predecessor president jakaya kikwete who served as global ambassador for immunization in early 2016
last month magufuli finally did admit that his country had a coronavirus problem urging tanzanians to wear locally made face masks
it took the death of zanzibars vice president seif sharif hamad apparently to break magufulis intransigence
several highranking officials from the political elite and close to magufuli have also died of the disease
as throngs of people continue to gather to pay their respects to the late president his death has also brought some relief
shortly after magufulis death writer elsie eyakuze came forward on social media to speak openly about what it was like to live through the pandemic in tanzania with a president who showed willful disregard for the coronavirus
in a long twitter thread she wrote
now
for the real story i have been at a loss to tell for too long
thread
in march of 2020 the covid19 pandemic started to rampage throughout the world
it did not spare tanzania
but in april of 2020 we stopped all public efforts to halt is spread in the country
elsie eyakuze mikochenireport march 20 2021
in one of her last tweets she asks
did he die of covid19 tho
yes he did
and him and her
and them
tanzanians
and beyond
but they are not who you want to talk about is it they are not the story
it is
a friend gets in touch
can you wellcan i make it personal please do
i will
tomorrow
elsie eyakuze mikochenireport march 20 2021
in an open letter to magufuli eyakuze points out the inconsistency of magufulis ideas but also applies the empathy magufuli himself seemed to lack at times  and forgives him

tanzanians are coming to terms with the complexity and gravity of magufulis death and the legacy he left behind  with a close eye on the future

the novel coronavirus was first reported in tanzania in midmarch 2020 but after recording up to 509 cases and 21 deaths in late april the nation announced its status as coronavirusfree in june
that same month kassim majaliwa the countrys prime minister told parliament there are only 66 active coronavirus cases in the country but did not provide further details
since then government has been silent on the coronavirus with a strong politic of denial and no data released to the public on infections or deaths
today most activities continue businessasusual including tanzanias tourism industry attracting thousands of visitors to its airports with few public health protocols in place
the airport in zanzibar received the lowest 2star rating on covid19 health and safety measures by skytrax covid19 airport safety rating the worlds only assessment and certification of airport health and safety measures during the pandemic
according to their report new cases of the south african virus variant were confirmed in two travelers flying into denmark on january 19 from tanzania
the highly anticipated annual african music festival sauti za busara will take place in midfebruary in zanzibar with support from the european union in tanzania and several european embassies despite the risk of highly contagious new coronavirus variants circulating in the united kingdom south africa and brazil
on january 24 the catholic archdiocese of arusha issued a letter warning congregants of the existence of covid19 in tanzania and urged members to follow all necessary public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus in churches
while tanzanias recorded cases are moderate compared to other countries the governments silence about covid19 data raised grave concerns among public health experts and human rights activists who are forbidden from speaking or talking about covid19 in digital spaces
the country updated its 2018 electronic and postal communications online content regulations in july prohibiting any content with information with regard to the outbreak of a deadly or contagious disease in the country or elsewhere without the approval of the respective authorities
despite initial restrictions to contain the spread of the virus schools colleges offices and other social activities are back to normal even as the virus continues to spread in the region
president john magufuli had cast doubt on the credibility of laboratory equipment and technicians after secret tests allegedly performed on papaya and a goat gave positive test results
the president said releasing this data was causing unnecessary panic and soon after fired nyambura moremi director of the national health laboratory for allegedly botching the testing results
the ministerial covid19 information team was dissolved
in june magufuli thanked god for eradicating the virus from tanzania following three days of national prayer
he made this announcement publicly during a sunday service amidst a praising congregation making claims that god had answered their prayers
he also praised congregants for not wearing face masks despite calls from the world health organization to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus
magufuli nicknamed the bulldozer for his tough anticorruption stance was reelected for a second time in october 2020 during an election that was highly criticized for stifling dissent and opposition
just before the elections tanzanians experienced an internet shutdown with access denied to all the major social media platforms including instagram whatsapp and twitter
to date many tanzanians cannot access twitter without using a virtual private network vpn
over the last five years the magufuli administration has narrowed democratic and civic spaces and has cracked down hard on freedom of expression and access to information in digital spaces
with the governments strong denial stance tanzanians are not allowed to release any covid19 data that the government has not verified which means that ordinary citizens as well as journalists and medical professionals are barred from commenting on covid19 in digital spaces or accessing information
access to covid19 information has become an elite privilege according to one doctor from the national hospital who spoke to global voices on the condition of anonymity fearing reprisal
unlike other countries with established covid19 information response teams who give daily updates on covid19 tanzania simply offers a website with limited and outdated covid19 information
the denial has been so convincing that its now widely accepted by tanzanians including medical experts who disregard basic safety measures like wearing face masks and social distancing
global voices visited major hospitals such muhimbili the government referral hospital in dar es salaam the cultural capital as well as benjamin mkapa hospital in dodoma the political capital and witnessed very few measures taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease
people are allowed to enter hospital premises without wearing masks there are few working hygiene and washing facilities and those that do exist lack water or are broken which was witnessed for example in the pregnant mothers clinic at muhimbili
while the magufuli administration has shown little concern about the impact of the virus on everyday citizens many government ministries and departments acknowledge that covid19 still exists
tanzanias minister of finance urges ministry staff to take all precautions against the coronavirus while also saying covid19 is not an issue in tanzania
screenshot from mwananchi newspaper
for example when magufuli was sworn in for the second time last year authorities did practice covid19 prevention measures requiring all attendees to have their temperatures taken and wash their hands at hygiene stations with hand sanitizer provided
on january 25 tanzanias minister of finance dr
philip mpango urged his staff to take precautions against covid19 while at the same denying its existence in tanzania during a meeting in dodoma the capital
most incountry experts are afraid to speak up fearing retaliation
global voices spoke with one medical expert who believed tanzania may be experiencing a second wave of the outbreak but that this information was kept secret from the public
the expert did not want to be named fearing reprisal
another medical expert told global voices under the conditions of anonymity that people must know their covid19 status so that they can take measures to prevent its spread in their communities
he said that leaving people uninformed makes their job very difficult and hopes that all tanzanians will try to protect themselves by taking all precautions advised by who
he told global voices
politicians have taken over the whole covid19 issue and they are playing a dangerous game but when people will start dying they will start sacking medical staff
another doctor who spoke to global voices anonymously said that although there is some hope in getting a vaccine tanzanias denial may slow down access to it as the government has not taken any steps to acquire it on the global market opting instead to invest in herbal remedies
in december 2020 health minister spokesman gerald chamii cast doubt on global vaccines telling the east african
it takes not less than six months to find a vaccine or cure for a certain disease
we have fared on our own since the pandemic spread i am not sure if it is wise to have a vaccine imported and distributed to the citizens without undertaking clinical testing to approve if it is safe for our people
access to information is essential to democracy and development
tanzanias cyber laws have been abused to target dissenting voices and those who have spoken out against tanzanias handling of covid19
freedom of expression including the right to access receive and impart information is enshrined in international law
in tanzania the right to be informed and to access and disseminate information is recognized in articles 181 and 182 of the constitution of the united republic of tanzania
nevertheless these rights are more cosmetic than based in reality
with fullthrottled covid19 denial and laws in place to prevent the open exchange of information and opinions on the disease on and offline tanzanians are left with severely limited access to information and many are afraid to speak out

a document from the mozambican police prm that has leaked in local media in early august revealed that 15 students had become pregnant at a police training school in matalane a district of maputo province
the document states that the pregnancies resulted from the students sexual relations with their instructors without specifying whether these relations were consensual
moreover it states that pregnant students will not be able to complete the course at present and will have their trips back to their home provinces paid for by the police
finally it says that the instructors involved will be suspended
when asked about the case by the newspaper o país on august 8 police commander general bernardino rafael said that those involved would face disciplinary proceedings
it did not take long before the case was widely condemned on social media
several users publicly expressed their disapproval of the schools measures as well as demanding justice for the women
activist fátima mimbire wrote on facebook
tratem o assunto matalane com a devida seriedade
estou de coração partido com esta notícia de 15 instruendas grávidas no centro de treinos de matalane
isso é grave
é grave porque como o próprio documento refere envolve os instrutores
ora uma pessoa que detém autoridade sobre outra a engravida e o fim é um processinho isso me lembra o professor que exige sexo às alunas em troca de notas ou para não serem humilhada na sala de aulas por serem na visão do professor burras no lugar de ser processado é transferido para ir dar aulas em outro lugar
e lá continua as suas façanhas
treat the matalane issue with the appropriate seriousness
i am heartbroken by this news of 15 pregnant students at the matalane training centre
this is serious
it is serious because as the document itself states it involves the instructors
now one person who holds authority over another gets them pregnant and the outcome is a little process this reminds me of the teacher who demanded sex from students in exchange for grades or not to be humiliated in class because in the teachers view they were dumb instead of being prosecuted he was transferred to teach somewhere else
and there he continues his exploits
txeka a womens activist collective also condemned the affair on twitter

the matalane case
blaming violence on women is a common practice in chauvinistpatriarchal societies known for devaluing women and submission to the wishes of men resulting in judgements about the victims conduct and minimizing the aggressors conduct

a petition is also running demanding punishment for the police officers involved
so far over 3800 people have signed it
on august 19 president filipe nyusi finally spoke about the case saying it will be investigated by the police
para o governo este caso é sério e está a ser investigado ao detalhe ao nível ministerial e do comandogeral da polícia da república de moçambique
o estado não deve nem vai tolerar situações como esta
a lei deverá ser cumprida e ela é igual para todos nós

decorrem inquéritos para aferir os contornos de cada um dos casos procurando salvaguardar o estado psíquico e emocional das gestantes porque elas merecem respeito humano
for the government this case is serious and is being investigated in detail at ministerial level and by the general police command of the republic of mozambique
the state should not and will not tolerate situations like this
the law must be upheld and it is the same for all of us
nobody is above the law
investigations are underway to assess the details of each case seeking to safeguard the psychological and emotional state of the pregnant women because they deserve humane respect
other cases
this adds to the cases of violence faced by mozambican women most of which go unreported by media
among the cases that have recently captured media attention is that of alberto niquice deputy for the party liberation front of mozambique frelimo whos facing criminal charges for raping a 13yearold child in 2018
early this year 30 mozambican civil society organizations demanded the suspension of niquices inauguration who was reelected in 2019
however the deputy took office and is working as normal in the assembly of the republic
another case covered in the press was the case of domestic violence suffered by josina machel daughter of mozambiques first president samora machel
in october 2015 josina was assaulted by her partner of three years rofino licuco leaving her blind in one eye
licuco was sentenced to 3 years and 4 months in prison as well as to pay 300 million meticais about us4
2 million in compensation to josina
however rofino appealed the sentence and in june this year the high court of appeals overturned it on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence in the case

african leaders have taken decisive early actions to curb the spread of covid19
in fact the africa centers for disease control acdc created its covid19 task force on february 5 before the continent had a single case

today africa is currently the least impacted region in the world with 1293048 confirmed covid19 cases so far and a remarkable 1031905 recoveries according to the africa cdcp
the continent has less than 5 percent of reported cases and less than 1 percent of all deaths

now as african countries  led by the african union   ease covid19 restrictions and prepare to reopen their economies and borders many governments are employing innovative technologies
a need for a unified panafrican technology that can track the spread and connect covid19 testing centers across the continent has led to the use of panabios an african unionbacked biosurveillance technology

panabios provides a mobile and webbased app that uses algorithms to track and trace persons facing potential health threats and track and keep records of test samples from their origin to incountry labs

the technology was developed by koldchain a kenyan startup and funded by afrochampions a publicprivate partnership designed to galvanize african resources and institutions to support the emergence and success of the african private sector

ghana is currently the only african country using panabios technology as it reopens its borders
panabios ensures that travelers are able to use test results from one country to satisfy port clearance requirements in another country through their personal panabios app or by adding a systemgenerated smsussd passcode to another travel document

port health officials use the enterprise version of the app to validate health declarations in a uniform manner across countries
comprehensive data protection and privacy laws
the african union and the africa cdcp are encouraging member states to integrate the mobilebased panabios platform that would allow results from facilities across the continent to be centralized
however digital health interventions have raised a lot of questions regarding data access and data privacy

governmentimplemented surveillance and control can instill fear and threaten civil liberties especially in a continent where only 27 countries out of 54 in africa have fully functioning data protection and privacy laws
some african countries such as ghana have triggered new legislation giving the president emergency powers to fight the pandemic by ordering telecom companies to provide it with personal customer details such as subscriber database subscriber cell reference data uncashed subscriber mobile money transfer data mobile money merchant codes and addresses

to ensure data protection and privacy all machine learning techniques used by panabios are on aggregated data
that is  data gathered is summarized for statistical analysis  not personal data used to target individuals  unless its for contact tracing purposes where it would be required to reach out to suspected or infected people

to ensure the prevention of privacy infringement the african union panabios and its partners must propose how it will comply with various countrybased data protection laws to protect privacy ensure data consent and avoid data sharing for commercial use

the app currently does not have a privacy policy available to the public in which it explains to users its data collection and sharing practices

the challenge is how such data privacy policy will meet the various continental national and regional data protection laws such as the african unions convention on cybersecurity and personal data protection the southern african development communitys sadc model law on data protection economic community of west african states ecowas supplementary act asa
10110 on personal data protection within ecowas and the east african communitys framework for cyberlaws

techbased solutions contribute to africas covid19 success 
in addition to panabios various african nations have activated techbased responses to the covid19 crisis to mitigate its spread

for example scientists from senegal developed a 1 covid19 test kit and 3d ventilators for patients
wellvis a nigerian startup created the covid19 triage tool a free online tool to help users selfassess their coronavirus risk category based on their symptoms and their exposure history
the south african government used whatsapp to provide an interactive chatbot that can answer common queries about covid19 myths symptoms and treatment
and in uganda market women used the market garden app to sell their goods from their homes through the app and then motorcycle taxis deliver the goods to customers
africas successful control and management of the spread of covid19 has been attributed to its younger population limited testing capacity and mortality tracking and the possible presence of sarscov2 antibodies found in some africans

however it is clear that africas techbased innovations are a major contributing factor to its success in controlling covid19 in addition to decisive leadership early on in the pandemic

solomon zewdu deputy doctor with the bill  melinda gates foundation summarized how in january even as many western nations hesitated ethiopia began intensive screening at addis ababa airport
rwanda became the first african nation to lock down on march 21 and many other african countries soon followed south africa implemented its comprehensive lockdown when it had only 400 cases and two fatalities
with a similarsized population italy had more than 9000 cases and 400 deaths when it acted
in contrast the number of infected cases and deaths in the us is six times that of africa
public health experts predicted that the pandemic would horribly affect the continent with bodies lying in the streets

clearly africa has proven otherwise

since september 22 news reports and social media posts circulating on the chinesespeaking internet inaccurately claim that world health organization who chief scientist dr
soumya swaminathan said chinas covid19 vaccines have proved to have an effect
these reports and posts cite as a source a oneminute video produced by china central television for the chinese videosharing app miaopai
the video shows a speech by who directorgeneral tedros adhanom ghebreyesus on the importance of the development of a covid19 vaccine followed by remarks by dr
swaminathan
in the cctv video whose captions say who chief scientist chinese covid19 vaccines have proved to have an effect 世卫组织首席科学家中国的新冠疫苗已被证明有效 this is swaminathans speech
as you know they also have a very active vaccine development programme and several of their vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of clinical trial so this is also of interest to us so were following those very closely
some of their candidates actually prove to be successful in the clinical trials that are going on
however dr
swaminathans original speech has been edited
her last sentence in reality began with the word if and the videos background music makes it sound as if shes saying proved instead of prove
dr
swaminathans complete remarks are the following
weve been engaged in discussions with china for the last several months because as you know they also have a very active vaccine development programme and several of their vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of clinical trial so this is also of interest to us so were following those very closely
weve had very constructive and open discussions with them and they have always been reiterating their commitment to global access if some of their candidates actually prove to be successful in the clinical trials that are going on emphasis added
so i think the conversations are going on its still open and were hopeful that more countries are going to join
the remarks were delivered at a who virtual press conference that took place on september 21
the complete transcripts of the one hour and 30 minutes event can be accessed here
the conference aimed to present updates on the 18billionusd initiative by who and other organizations to deploy a future covid19 vaccine around the world
so far 156 countries have signed up for the program neither china nor the u
s

hundreds of angolans took to the streets on september 12 in luanda benguela and in cities in 15 other provinces against police violence
the demonstrations took place following the shock from the news that silvio dala a 35yearold doctor lost his life on september 1 while in police custody
according to the authorities dala left by car from the david bernardino paediatric hospital in luanda where he worked as clinical director when he was stopped by police officers for not wearing a mask
the doctor was then taken to the catotes police station in the capitals rocha pinto neighbourhood when he showed signs of fatigue and began to faint having had a bad fall which caused minor injuries to the head the official police statement said
it also states that dala died while officers were taking him to hospital
the union of doctors contests this version
the organizations president adriano manuel told voice of america voa that there are contradictions in the authorities explanations which suggest that the doctor was subjected to physical abuse
manuel told deutsche welle dw that the cause of death described by the police is not the real one
anyone who is a doctor and has studied medicine knows that this is not what killed silvio
according to dw a source from the ministry of the interior said that the autopsy carried out in the presence of the family and a prosecutor concluded that the doctor was not the victim of an assault
the union said it will take legal action against the police
meanwhile the angolan government announced the creation of a commission with the ministry of health to investigate the incident
the protesters also did not believe the polices version of dalas death
signs used at the protests in luanda in different parts of the city said no more killings you are paid to protect you are not paid to kill i am silvio dala they killed silvio dala
there were also calls for the minister of the interior eugénio laborinho to resign
the demonstrations were organized by the union of doctors and by various civil society collectives and organizations

speaking to lusa the rapper brigadeiro 10 pacotes whose real name is bruno santos called for lugarinhos resignation as well as better police training schools to improve their conduct
the police is an organization that must give citizens confidence today we live in serious insecurity where all citizens are afraid when they come across the police he said

hachalu hundessa interview with omn via firaabeek entertainment  cc by 3

editors note this is a twopart analysis on hachalu hundessa a popular oromo musician whose murder incited ethnoreligious violence fueled by disinformation online
read part ii here

iconic ethiopian singer hachalu hundessa gained prominence for using his creative talent to raise the consciousness of the oromo people
he was assassinated in a suburb of ethiopias capital addis ababa on june 29
that night at 930 pm as hachalu was exiting his vehicle a man named tilahun yami allegedly walked up to his car and fired a gun into the artists chest
he was rushed to the nearest hospital where he was officially declared dead
it was later determined that the bullet severely damaged his internal organs
addis ababas police chief reported two suspects were arrested
after a few days government authorities charged an alleged assassin along with two other accomplices
in the wake of his murder the country has struggled to come to terms with the violence that followed
the truth of hachalus assassination is not yet fully clear and in its aftermath speculation began to fly as politicians and activists stoked longstanding tensions between oromo and amahara elites two of ethiopias largest ethnic groups
that day mourners flooded the streets of addis ababa and cities and towns across oromia state
the next morning oromia media network omn a satellite tv station on which hachalu had his last contentious interview provided online and tv coverage as his casket was transferred from addis ababa to hachalus hometown ambo
the slow televised journey turned into a deadly battle between government authorities and opposition politicians over where hachalu would be buried and omn interrupted its coverage as the hearse was forced to return to addis ababa
at least ten people were killed and several were injured in addis ababa

the scuffle led to the arrest of several opposition politicians including jawar mohammed an omn figurehead and opposition politician bekele gerba who were both charged with instigating the mayhem
confusion swirled after government authorities eventually took halachus body back to ambo by helicopter where feuding parties continued to clash denying the bereaved family members a proper burial
meanwhile turmoil and violence ensued
a threeday rampage gripped parts of oromia and addis ababa at a substantial cost 239 people were left dead hundreds of others were injured and more than 7000 people were arrested for violence and property damage worth millions of ethiopian birr
on june 30 the government imposed an internet shutdown to attempt to halt calls for violence circulating on social media that lasted three weeks
a number of people were shot and killed by government security forces but several news outlets including voice of america and addis standard reported that angry mobs from the oromo ethnic group attacked multiethnic interfaith towns and cities in southeastern oromia targeting nonoromo nonmuslim families in the region
most of the violence fell along ethnic amaharaoromo lines but religion may have played a more central role due to an intricate localized understanding of ethnicity the southeast oromo communitys ethnic identity markers usually combine the religion of islam and the afanoromo language
a local farmer reportedly said we thought hachalu was oromo after he watched hachalus televised funeral rites that followed the traditions of the ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church
according to reports most victims of the most gruesome violence were minority christian amharas christian oromos and gurage people
eyewitnesses say mobs destroyed and burned property committed lynching and beheadings and dismembered victims
a fateful interview
when news of hachalus assassination first hit oromo diaspora media outlets zeroed in on hachalus fateful interview with omn host guyo wariyo that aired the week before halachu was killed
during the interview guyo repeatedly asked hachalu provocative questions about his alleged sympathy for the ruling party interrupting him multiple times to challenge his answers
hachalu fiercely denied any sympathies with the ruling party but also decried the deeply discordant and fractionalized oromo political parties demonstrating his staunch independence as a thinker and musician  a quality that made him a target for online abuse until the day of his murder
at one point however guyo asked hachalu about the historical injustices allegedly committed against the oromo people by menelik ii ethiopias 19thcentury emperor who shaped modern ethiopia
hachalu shocked some listeners when he answered that the horse seen immortalized in meneliks equestrian statue in addis ababa belongs to an oromo farmer called sida debelle and that menelik robbed that horse
this exchange attracted applause  and criticism  from commentators on facebook and twitter
when hachalu was killed one week later many members of the oromo diaspora community immediately speculated that hachalus criticism of the menelik ii statue infuriated sympathizers of imperial ethiopia which may have led to his murder
on social media oromo netizens focused obsessively on hachalus menelikrelated remarks which led many down a winding path to an insidious disinformation campaign
the rest of the interview contains other loaded issues of divisions and contradictions within the oromo community
throughout the interview guyo grilled hachalu about the countrys ongoing political reforms stoking antigovernment sentiment with questions about prime minister abiy ahmed himself an oromo and whether or not the government had met the demands of the oromo people after the prime minister came to power in 2018
hachalu reiterated his noninvolvement in the rabid partisanship of oromo politics but he did criticize those who question abiys oromo identity
he defended his position against top oromo opposition leaders who sought an alliance with the tigray peoples liberation front tplf a oncedominant party with historic ties to the nowdefunct ethiopian peoples revolutionary front the eprdf
the tplf turned into an opposition party after abiy dismantled the eprdf
hachalu also addressed the political violence in the oromia region blaming both government authorities and the militant splinter rightwing oromo liberation front olf militia group informally known as olfshane
following hachalus murder the government was able to acquire and release the full 71minute interview to the public
the missing tape included hachalus accounts of death threats he received from parts of western oromia where the radical olfshane militia is active
hachalu said he believed he would not have been attacked on social media if he had praised olfshane
he addressed a direct conflict he had with getachew assefa ethiopias security and intelligence chief during the tplf period
guyo who promoted this interview on facebook as mustsee tv in the days before its broadcast has since been arrested and the government is investigating the full 71minutes of interview tape for further clues that may help determine the facts regarding hachalus murder

screenshot from a guardian youtube video about female genital mutilation
covid19 has deeply affected womens rights in the middle east and north africa mena from increased domestic violence to job loss
but there is also one less visible area where women are affected female genital mutilation fgm due to disruption in prevention because of the pandemic

in april the united nations announced that due to pandemicrelated disruptions in prevention programs two million fgm cases could occur over the next decade that would otherwise have been averted

female genital mutilation includes all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons according to the world health organization who
the practice rooted in extensive traditions cultural and religious beliefs throughout africa the middle east and asia is typically performed by traditional midwives or healers using knives razors or glass
fgm also known as genital cutting is widely considered as one of the most extreme manifestations of violence against girls and women and yet it is widely underreported in the middle east
it is estimated that it affects at least 200 million women worldwide
the issue is explained in this unicef video 
in the mena region female genital mutilation fgm is a problem that primarily concerns egypt sudan yemen iraq and djibouti
carlos javier aguilar regional adviser child protection explains more

comorjjviql8r
unicef mena  يونيسف الشرق الأوسط وشمال إفريقيا unicefmena february 7 2020
somalia has the highest prevalence of fgm with an estimated 98 percent of females between 15 and 49 years who experienced genital cutting
in djibouti an estimated 93 percent are affected egypt 91 percent sudan 88 percent mauritania 69 percent yemen19 percent and iraq 7 percent according to the latest figures released in june by the united nations population fund unfpa

the practice varies according to social class ethnicity and education in each country with notable differences between urban and rural areas
fgm more often occurs among the poorest least educated families in rural areas
in yemen fgm is concentrated in coastal regions but less common in the north
in iraq the practice is more prevalent in northern kurdish provinces
in egypt it is markedly higher among girls living in upper egypt

in mauritania more than 90 percent of women from the poorest families have endured fgm compared to 37 percent of women from the richest families
fgm an underreported violation 
the scale and scope of fgm may be underestimated because the official global picture of fgmc is incomplete according to a joint report from march authored by equality now end fgm european network and the us end fgmc network
the report revealed growing evidence that the ritual is also practiced in other regions including the middle east and asia and the world woefully underestimates fgm

small sample researches have recently shown that fgm is also practiced in iran along with gulf states such as kuwait the uae oman and saudi arabia
divya srinivasan from equality now told reuters that she was particularly surprised at the results of small studies from places like saudi arabia and oman which are not normally countries that come to mind when you think of fgm
the report published during the peak of the covid19 crisis in the middle east was not picked up by the arabic speaking media or translated into arabic with little coverage of fgm in arabic at all
this lack of public awareness may perpetuate the perception that fgm is not an issue of concern

social taboos
in the middle east taboos around womens bodies and sexuality prevent open public discussions about sensitive issues like fgm often tied to cultural religious and traditional beliefs

in egypt for example christians and muslims both believe that circumcision of girls prevents them from vice and makes them more attractive for future husbands mothers fear that their daughters cant get married if they have not been cut according to a report by stop fgm middle east a campaign created in 2013 to raise awareness about fgm and whose aim is to get the message out that fgm exists not only in africa but also in many countries in the middle east and asia
the organization lobbies for more data on fgm and has created a survey toolkit to help individuals and groups create smallscale surveys on fgm

unless there is a critical incident that makes headlines such as the recent fgmrelated death of a 12yearold girl in southern egypt in february people tend to avoid the topic

ghida hussein an egyptian student researching fgm told global voices 
as we dont talk about it it is as if the problem doesnt exist
fgm is often practiced silently behind closed doors
it is happening far from the more educated urban centers of power where activists and politicians are seated
fgm is a controversial sensitive issue and unless there is international attention and funding it is not seen locally as a priority by an overwhelming male political class

breaking the taboo and speaking out about fgm can expose human rights defenders and victims to hate speech and backlash

in oman womens rights activist habiba al hinai founder of the omani association for human rights oahr conducted a survey in oman in 2017 and found that 78 percent of women have been cut

after publishing her findings online habiba received attacks and threats 
i posted my results online and the response was huge
i was attacked by religious conservatives who say female circumcision is a form of islamic worship
in oman where fgm is not officially recognized there is no protection or support for victims
habiba added in the report
how can you ask a survivor to speak out against fgm and then face all the consequences criticism and online defamation her family and her tribe may disown her maybe her husband will divorce her  without proper support
i dont expect these women to speak out and face society
fgm eradication too slow too inadequate 
in yemen and the united arab emirates fgm is only banned in medical facilities but not in homes
in mauritania there are legal restrictions but not an outright ban
in iraq fgm is outlawed in the kurdish autonomous region but is still legal in central iraq

there have however been some major breakthroughs to eradicate fgm
following years of advocacy from womens rights organizations egypt banned the practice in 2008
sudan in a political transition after 30 years of dictatorship is the latest to outlaw fgm in april
but law enforcement remains a major challenge because fgm still has a high degree of acceptance and prevalence

although laws are an important deterrent they are not enough
states need national comprehensible strategies that include input from police judiciary clerics health care providers and education to civil society

a series of regional crises and authoritarian rule has delayed reforms limiting campaigns and resources to tackle womens rights violations

now with the worlds attention shifted to covid19 and its economic impact many programs that advocate for womens rights and provide social services to vulnerable women are postponed or no longer a priority
with more families falling below the poverty line and girls taken out of school or forced into early marriage fgm is also likely to continue to take place without notice in the region

dadiyatas wife watched from her room as they drove her husband away

sadly theres still no information about dadiyatas whereabouts
it is painful kadija told the bbc as their children keep asking about their missing father

rather than finding dadiyata nigerian security agencies are absolving themselves from any form of guilt or blame for his disappearance

nigerias department of state security dss had in january denied having dadiyata in their custody
the state security agency stated that since dadiyata was taken away from his house by some armed men does not suggest that those men were dss staff
similarly aisha dikko the attorney general of kaduna state denied knowing the whereabouts or of being involved whatsoever in dadiyatas abduction
anything to the contrary is a vile assertion that seeks to stretch the fact that he was abducted within kaduna state to mean the involvement of the state government said dikko
however these denials by dss and kaduna state government neither mitigates the agony of dadiyatas wife and their two children  nor does it restore his liberty

the plea for dadiyatas release still echoes on twitter in this hashtag oneyearwithoutdadiyata as nigerians demand his release
bulama bukarti lamented about the trauma that this kind of impunity has caused dadiyatas family
its unfathomable how a nigerian would disappear just like that

besides saying that they dont know where he is
nobody has really made the effort to tell us what they have done to find him and how it is that they cant account for him
it tells you how so little we matter as citizens
the least we can do is ask where dadiyata is and why cant our government find him

goodluck ebele jonathan gej was nigerias president when in april 2014 276 schoolgirls from a government secondary school were kidnapped by boko haram militants from the northeastern town of chibok

the kidnapping of the dambakasaya school children and their teacher is a grisly deja vu

the only difference is that this time around those responsible for this horrendous incident are not boko haram  but armed bandits

the rampaging bandits of kaduna
banditry violence spiked in nigerias northwestern states of zamfara kaduna niger sokoto kebbi and katsina

acaps an independent humanitarian think tank asserts that this armed violence is unconnected to the boko haram insurgency in the northeast 
the banditry violence began as a farmerherder conflict in 2011 and intensified between 2017 to 2018 to include cattle rustling kidnapping for ransom sexual violence and killings
by march 2020 more than 210000 people have been internally displaced
rural communities have been left at the mercy of these bandits who between january and june this year have killed at least 1126 people in northern nigeria

villages in southern kaduna are the worst hit with 366 lives lost in the first half of 2020 says amnesty international

chikun lga the home of the kidnapped students had experienced a series of militia attacks that has resulted in the deaths abduction with 45 communities displaced and occupied since 2019 according to the southern kaduna peoples union

the people of southern kaduna allege that the bandits are fulani herders on a land grab mission with the passive consent of both the federal and state governments
but kaduna state governor nasir elrufai denied that the carnage had anything to do with land grabbing nor any ethnoreligious motivation

on august 22 the kaduna state government relaxed the curfew from 6 p

we strongly condemn the arrest of poet henry swapon and demand his unconditional release
the arrest of lawyer imtiaz mahmood
on the morning of 15 may police arrested supreme court lawyer and writer imtiaz mahmud in a case filed in 2017 under the countrys nowdefunct information and communication technology act in which a private citizen shafiqul islam alleged that one of mahmoods facebook posts had hurt religious sentiments and incited communal violence in bangladeshs southeastern chittagong region
imtiaz mahmood secured an anticipatory bail when the case was originally brought but a khagrachhari court issued another arrest warrant against him in january 2019
mahmood had commented on ethnic tensions that arose after a bengali motorcyclist was killed in khagrachhari prompting a group of bengalis to torch a number of houses and shops of the indigenous people in the rangamati area of chittagong
local sources told the dhaka tribune that police had taken no measures to control the situation
hundreds of similar lawsuits were filed from 2013 until 2018 when the ict act was effectively replaced by the digital security act

if one sues them is an arrest warrant issued immediately

the bangladesh government cannot ensure public safety but prompt to arrest people under the repressive digital security act which is by the way against the very spirit of the constitution of bangladesh

despite concerns about its implications for freedom of expression the bangladeshi parliament approved the digital security act in september 2018
the law replaced the notorious information and  technology act which had also been used as a tool for silencing critical speech online
the act criminalizes various types of online speech ranging from defamatory messages to speech that injures religious values or sentiments introducing hefty fines
it also authorizes lengthy prison sentences for using the internet to create public unrest and for gathering sending or preserving classified government documents using a digital device
the editors council of bangladesh said that the act is against the freedom guaranteed by the constitution media freedom and freedom of speech

in the aftermath of the sudanese revolution transitional authorities of sudan have signed a peace agreement with the sudan revolutionary front  the main rebel group still active after former leader omar albashir was deposed last year
the historic peace agreement signed on august 31 in the city of juba south sudan found regional and international support from troika countries the european union egypt and several gulf countries
but this exciting moment is also overshadowed by a period of historic flooding that has devastated parts of sudan causing a downward spiral in an already stressed economy
still sudanese citizens on social media also welcomed the news

sudans prime minister abdalla hamdok welcomed the peace agreement saying
أهدي السلام الذي وقعناه اليوم بدولة جنوب السودان الشقيق إلى أطفالنا الذين ولدوا في معسكرات النزوح واللجوء لأمهات وآباء يشتاقون لقراهم ومدنهم ينتظرون من ثورة ديسمبر المجيدة وعد العودة وعد العدالة وعد التنمية ووعد الأمان

i dedicate the peace that we signed today in the brotherly state of south sudan to our children who were born in displacement and asylum camps to mothers and fathers who long for their villages and cities waiting for the glorious december revolution the promise of return the promise of justice the promise of development and the promise of safety
the agreement guaranteed autonomy for rebel groups in their controlled areas under the supervision of the federal government
it will guarantee onethird of parliament chairs for people from rebel areas in order to reflect their needs and issues
the agreement will guarantee justice and equality for those who were persecuted by the former regime often for being nonmuslim and nonarab
this is not the first peace agreement in sudan history
some netizens say that peace agreements are routine in sudan and may not bring peace and stability

incomplete agreement
despite this exciting moment two main rebel groups did not sign the agreement the slma led by abdul wahid alnur and sudan peoples liberation movementnorth splmn led by abdelaziz alhilu both refrained due to lingering questions about the mechanisms for integrating armies and the country identity
three days after the peace signing sudan pm abdalla hamdok traveled to addis ababa ethiopia to meet with alhilu to discuss points of contention according to sudan tribune
prime minister abdallah hamdok on wednesday held a secret meeting with abdel aziz alhilu in an effort to break the deadlock in the peace talks mediated by the south sudanese government

sudan tribune sudantribune_en september 3 2020
the meeting resulted in the signing of a joint agreement of memorandum reinforcing the principles of the peace talks in juba
sudan social media buzzed with a circulated copy of the agreement in english with a particular focus on article 3 on the subject of religion and state 
a democratic state must be established in sudan
for sudan to become a democratic country where the rights of all citizens are enshrined the constitution should be based on the principle of separation of religion and state in the absence of which the right to selfdetermination must be respected
freedom of belief and worship and religious practice shall be guaranteed in full to all sudanese citizens
the state shall not establish an official religion
no citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion
sudanese people split into two camps on the matter the first sees the separation of religion and state as a guarantee of fundamental human rights the second says the transitional government does not have the right to decide this without authorization from citizens via democratic elections
following the meeting the prime ministers twitter account published an arabic version of the agreement that differed from the english one addressed as a joint press release
while the english document emphasized the separation of religion from the state as an inevitability the arabic document only recommended discussion of the controversial issue
the differences between the two documents raise questions about the future of this agreement
historic peace historic floods
while peace has brought happy news to sudan the nile river continues to flood ushering in an unprecedented humanitarian disaster

therefore we launch a directive to all official bodies and an appeal to all civil authorities and organizations to come to the rescue of the citizens as soon as possible and to provide shelter medicines and food

these are the ones who will build sudan  and not the ones who are fighting for power now
sudanese citizens lack basic necessities like bread gas medicine and electricity  with power outages up to six hours a day
the sudanese pounds inflation rate has exceeded 202 percent according to professor steve hanke
yet transitional authorities have not been able to gain control over the market
now that theres again the promise of peace what are the governments plans to make life easier for citizens
student leader jutatip sirikhan covered herself in white paint in a symbolic act of protest following her release
photo and caption from prachatai
this article is from prachatai an independent news site in thailand edited and republished by global voices as part of a contentsharing agreement
student union of thailand sut president jutatip sirikhan has been arrested while on the way to university on september 1 for her participation in the july 18 mass protest
jutatip was arrested while in a taxi on her way to class at thammasat universitys tha prachan campus in bangkok
she went live on facebook at 1250 pm on september 1 when plainclothes police officers stopped the taxi she was in and delivered an arrest warrant
jutatip was taken to samranrat police station
an officer accompanied her in another taxi to the station since she did not feel safe enough to travel in the private car the officers brought to arrest her
she stayed live on facebook and read out passages from the thai translation of thomas paines common sense during the travel to the station
she was then taken to the bangkok criminal court and was granted bail and released at 520 pm in the custody of a lecturer at thammasat university
the court did not require her to immediately pay the 100000 baht 3190 us dollars bail but imposed the condition that she does not repeat the actions for which she was being charged  the same condition given to everyone else who has been arrested and released on the same charges
jutatip is the 14th activist to be arrested for participating in the july 18 mass protest
fifteen other participants at the protest have also received a summons and reported to samranrat police station to hear the charges against them on august 28
jutatip was charged with sedition and violation of the emergency decree and the communicable diseases act among other charges
jutatip appeared in front of the criminal court after her release and gave a short press conference
paint can be washed out but we cant wash out injustice
i didnt intend to run away to begin with
i know i have an arrest warrant
i have been waiting to be arrested for a very long time but it didnt happen until today
each time someone gets arrested there will be slurs against our side that we did not protest peacefully
i am a student and i have been harassed by the police for months for years
why is there no compensation for me why must there be compensation for the police who are servants of the dictatorship
there should actually be a summons first but what happened was that the police brought the arrest warrant and arrested me
its extremely unfair to a student
they followed me with my phone signal followed me from where im staying
they threatened my home they threatened my family they took a warrant to my house so now we have to escalate our protest
everything is supported by the constitution
we pay our taxes
we must receive protection from the state not harassment from the state
so today i have to express myself symbolically that we can do this
we must stand by our rights and freedoms
throwing paint is also something that can be done
jutatip then threw a bucket of white paint over herself while holding up her hand in the threefinger hunger games salute
she said that the white paint represents purity and justice and that they are demanding justice back
we are showing that this is freedom this is the kind of expression we can do
even if now it is throwing paint over ourselves it is a way of showing that we can throw paint at any time
we can throw paint over those with power because those with power throw legal charges over us throw bullets at us without exception
paint can be washed out but we cant wash out injustice
afterward jutatip thanked the lecturer who came to make bail for her and the people who came to support her and helped the crowd clean the paint off the sidewalk in front of the footpath in front of the court
we wont stop fighting until we win in everything including monarchy reform and a new constitution jutatip said

this post was written by grace jolliffe and originally appeared on video volunteers an awardwinning international community media organisation based in india
a slightly edited version is published below as part of a contentsharing agreement
while india is going through a major general election spread over seven phases from 11 april to 19 may 2019 in order to elect its 17th parliament lok sabha some indian voters have taken the unusual step of boycotting the electoral process
read more all you need to know about indias 2019 general elections
in goa a southwestern state of india residents of a tribal hamlet in canacona block district subdivision marlem village refused to vote on 23 april during the third phase of the general election alleging that the government had been oblivious to the problems of their village
their main grievance is that basic facilities such as proper roads and water supply have not been provided by the government
a video by community correspondent devidas gaonkar a member of the aboriginal shepherd tribe of goa called velip documented the protests of the villagers
in this video pandurang gaonkar a resident from marli village states that
tirwal to marlem is a threequilometres road stretch which is incomplete
to date no action has been taken by the authorities
they only make false promises but no implementation
for this reason we havent cast our votes
the residents of marlem have been living in this village for more than 20 years
in 1968 the forest department declared marlem village part of a wildlife sanctuary
this makes the construction of roads or any development work in this area a rather complex issue
according to reports an underground power cabling project for carrying electricity to the area had been initially approved but when digging work commenced it was soon halted following objections coming from the state forest department
another source of frustration for the local population is the absence of proper roads
one has to navigate a 2
8 km unpaved and broken road to reach the first household at marlem from the main road
finally the supply of electricity and safe drinking water remain a challenge for the villagers
having publicly and repeatedly voiced their complaints but failing to get any answers the residents of marlem as well as residents from two other villages decided not to vote in the elections in order to draw the attention of the authorities towards their issues
polling officials came to talk to us but our decision of not to vote still stands added pandurang
isidore fernandes an opposition indian national congress member of the legislative assembly of cancona also met the locals
after hearing the grievances he assured his support in favour of their agitation
it is important for any government to provide road water and electricity to people
till now all government officials have neglected these facilities in marlem village stated fernandes
boycotting elections is now becoming a way of protest although voting is not mandatory in india
apart from goa villages in the central state of madhya pradesh the western state of  maharashtra and the eastern state of odisha are employing this method in order to get pressing issues addressed by the authorities in charge
so far none of those boycotts seem to have translated into action on the side of government
ultimately voters are adopting such tactics as a show of frustration towards officials and politicians who often reach out to neglected communities only before elections in hope of securing their votes but fail to deliver once the elections are over
in the end if boycotting elections does not heed changes in society what else can members of neglected communities do to get the attention of those supposed to hear them and take proper action
the journalist amade abubacar
photo screengrab caiccajudayoutube
journalists amade abubacar and germano adriano who were detained earlier this year while covering the military conflict in northern mozambique were released pending trial on 23 april 2019
amade who contributes to various local media outlets including zitamar news and a carta was detained on 5 january while he interviewed internally displaced people in the macomia district of cabo delgado a northern province of the country
germano a reporter for the local community radio nacedje disappeared on 6 february and was found to have been detained on 18 february
according to the media institute of southern africa misa amade and germano were charged with spreading defamatory messages against members of the mozambican armed defence forces via a facebook account that announced attacks which occurred in villages in the district of macomia
the journalists were released from the provincial jail of mieze in pemba cabo delgados capital and will be on probation as they await trial before the provincial judicial court of cabo delgado
their first hearing is scheduled for 17 may
since 2017 groups armed with knives have carried out attacks on villages in cabo delgado burning houses and decapitating residents
more than 90 people have died since the attacks began according to the police
to date no group has publicly claimed responsibility for the attacks
in december 2018 the newspaper a carta de moçambique revealed the existence of a facebook page run under a name that appears to have been falsified that praised the armed groups attacks in cabo delgado
it unknown whether or not the accusations against amade and germano are concerning this same page
the journalists defence team says there is no connection between them and any illegal activity via facebook
the proceedings against the journalists have been marked by irregularities
after detaining amade the police placed him in military custody
he was put in a military prison where he spent 12 days incommunicado before being transferred to a civilian prison
the journalists were only charged on 16 april violating the deadline of 90 days set out in the mozambican law of pretrial detention in the case of abubacar
in court proceedings during their pretrial detention both journalists were accused of crimes of violating state secrets through digital means and public incitement to a crime using digital means
these accusations differ from the formal charges that have now been filed against them which misa described as spreading defamatory messages against members of the mozambican armed defence forces via a facebook account that announced attacks which occurred in villages in the district of macomia
during the 106 days he spent in prison abubacar faced a lack of food and refusal of medical assistance according to amnesty international
his family told the newspaper verdade that they were stopped from visiting him during the whole time that abubacar was in custody
what has happened to these journalists may be part of a trend of intimidation against media workers in northern mozambique
independent investigative journalist estácio valoi was detained in december 2018 also in cabo delgado on legally dubious terms
he was later released without any charge but his work equipment remains in the armys custody
calls for justice
cídia chissungo an activist and organiser of the freeamade campaign celebrated the news
amadeabubacar and geramanoadriano are finally free
after almost 4 months detained
ofcourse we have to celebrate but we wont forget how everything started
we said a long time ago

the fact that he had to endure detention without trial for 106 days before getting bail is unconscionable
he should not be facing trial at all httpst

global voices cofounder ethan zuckerman defines bridge figures as people who are passionate about explaining their home cultures to people from other societies
the concept was developed through the deep roots it has in global voices and defines much of the work and ethos of the community
since our iran coverage aims to bridge the divide that exists between external perspectives on iran and the actual country itself global voices iran has started a series of interviews with various iranian journalists and writers who practice this role
these interviews are done to understand how and why these figures who make a career out of communicating the intricacies and complexities of a country riddled with contradictions explain iran to noniranians

golnaz esfandiari i think the use of social media in iran and its significance is increasing

i think the use of social media in iran and its significance is increasing
government officials admit that and i also see more people inside the country using social media sites and apps
i actually think that since 2009 the use of social media has increased considerably
some iranians told me they joined twitter after reading about the allegations about a twitter revolution in iran
social networking sites have facilitated conversation and the sharing of content that is banned or considered sensitive people can discuss taboo subjects relatively openly
they also challenge state policies and stances on social media quite regularly

read more how kelly golnoush niknejads tehran bureau bridges iran and the west
on misconceptions that noniranians have about iran she explained
when it comes to iran i often find myself having to go all the way back to 1979 then explaining the transformations that took place decadebydecade just to make sense of the present
its sometimes even hard for iranians themselves to believe what goes on in iran let alone noniranians
this explains why its vital to cover iran from the bottom up chronicling the lives of ordinary people
covering a country by reporting on the pronouncements of the ruling elite is probably the least interesting or informative kind of journalism
thats why even very sophisticated people who follow the news on iran have no idea what goes on there
of course if they followed tehran bureau though they would get a very dynamic view

ansary said she was cautiously optimistic about the future of iran and the place of women in it
only because i see their resilience
and this is because female activism has yielded partial results women were not allowed to serve as judges but can now serve as investigative judges
women werent allowed to enter certain fields of study and over the years they have been able to penetrate into male dominated areas such as medicine and engineering
im cautiously optimistic but i believe women will be at the forefront of any change in iran

when i insisted on continuing to what i was doing writing and promoting the things i believed in i was arrested and thrown into jail
hooman majd iran is not uniquely paradoxical whats unique is that most people dont know about iran
we are now at a turning point in us foreign policy
weeks away from the end of the obama presidency there is a strong possibility that the us is moving away from the defining project of rapprochement with its longtime foe the islamic republic of iran
at the dawn of the donald trump presidency which is slated to be a peculiar shade of hardline and hawkish republicanism i thought it a timely moment to sit down with journalist and author hooman majd
his books articles and commentary explaining the paradoxes of iran became widely featured in the american mainstream media during the bush era when hawkish rhetoric against the iranian government became a hallmark of the early 2000s foreign policy and media depictions of iran
hooman majd has been known to be the voice of iran to the western world

but iranianamericans and iranianeuropeans have written a lot about the culture in the recent years and theres a lot more travel between iran and the us among both iranianamericans and iranians themselves

on may 15 thousands of brazilians took to the streets in all 26 states and the federal district against the bolsonaro governments slashing of federal funds to education that will affect dozens of universities and schools
at the end of april brazils government announced cuts of 30 percent on a socalled discretionary budget which goes towards expenses such as electricity water general maintenance and research
when considering the total federal budget for higher education the cuts would amount to around 35 percent
besides the government has suspended funds for 3500 publiclyfunded postgraduate scholarships
from paulista avenue in são paulo a traditional gathering spot for protests to far away indigenous lands in alto rio negro near the border with colombia people went out to defend their public education

brazil has 69 federal universities and a large number of state universities all offering undergraduate and postgraduate education completely free of tuition and several communityoriented services such as extension courses legal assistance offices and hospitals
initially the cuts would apply to only three federal universities but they were later extended to the entire federal network
bolsonaros education minister abraham weintraub says that theyre not cuts but a contingency of expenses
weintraub has justified the cuts because public universities are places of mayhem
when asked by reporters to name examples of such mayhem he mentioned the presence of social movements in campuses and parties with naked people
weintraub was appointed as minister in early april after his shortlived predecessors administration became involved in a series of controversies
the new minister often voices rightwing conspiracy theories such as that crack cocaine was introduced in brazil as part of a communist plot and that he wants to erase cultural marxism from universities
some university deans have said that the cuts might impede them from opening their doors as early as the second semester of 2019
the federal prosecutors office has sent a report to the attorney general claiming the cuts violate brazils constitution

the study has developed a tool that monitors whatsapp groups and is widely used by factchecking agencies in brazil
lead researcher fabrício benevuto said on a facebook post on may 8
são monografiasdissertaçõeseventos ridicularizados por seus títulos e temas
são imagens de pessoas peladas em festas que nem são nas universidades e protestos e memes dizendo que os alunos das federais levam mais de 12 anos pra formar pois só usam drogas
claramente é um esforço orquestrado
trabalho de profissional
segue o mesmo estilo da campanha eleitoral
quem financia essa fábrica de desinformação
the images include monographiesdissertationevents mocked by their titles and topics
there are images of naked people in parties that arent even in universities and protests and memes that say university students take 12 years to graduate because theyre on drugs all the time
its clearly an orchestrated effort
a professionals job
its the same style of the electoral campaign
who finances this factory of disinformation
an article by website ciência na rua science in the streets in portuguese claims that public universities produce 95 percent of scientific research in brazil
a study by the united states consultancy clarivate analytics in 2018 points out that on the top 20 universities with the most prominent research production 15 are part of the federal network
on the day of the protests minister weintraub was summoned to testify about the budget cuts in the lower house of congress

meanwhile bolsonaro was in texas in the united states where he met former us president george w
bush
when asked about the protests the president said
é natural que haja protesto agora a maioria ali é militante  não tem nada na cabeça se perguntar 78 pra ele não sabe
se você perguntar a fórmula da água não sabe não sabe nada
são uns idiotas úteis uns imbecis que estão sendo usados como massa de manobra de uma minoria espertalhona que compõe o núcleo de muitas universidades federais no brasil
its natural that protests happen now the majority of people there are militants with nothing inside their heads
if you ask the result of 7 times 8 they wont know
if you ask about the composition of water they wont know they know nothing
they are useful idiots imbeciles and are being manipulated by a canny minority that commands many federal universities in brazil

screenshot from the other side gertrude uwitware tumusiime on youtube
in uganda female journalists who embrace digital tools to report share views and access information face attacks and harassment for investigating and publishing sensitive political content
online harassment has become a new form of censorship
women journalists carry the double burden of genderbased abuse online in addition to potential threats related to political reporting
these ongoing threats have led women journos to withdraw from public discourse  leaving the journalism profession dominated by men

in november 2016 ugandan journalist joy doreen biira who was working at the privatelyowned kenya television network ktn in kenya returned home to uganda for a traditional ceremony
while biira was home ugandan security forces clashed with members of the traditional rwenzururu kingdom in the rwenzori region of western uganda and their palace was burned to the ground
the gunbattle resulted in 62 deaths including 16 policemen
biira reacted to the military raid by posting her thoughts on facebook on november 27
its so sad what ive witnessed today with my own eyes  part of the palace of the kingdom im from the rwenzururu kingdom burning down
it felt like watching your heritage deplete before my eyes
that same day biira was arrested and accused of circulating graphic photos of the aftermath of a deadly battle between security forces and the regional kings royal guard of the rwenzururu kingdom  to a widely subscribed whatsapp group according to the committee to protect journalists cpj
she also posted an instagram video of the kings palace burning and wrote about it on facebook cpj reported
uganda security officers allegedly forced biira to delete social media posts and her digital tools were also confiscated  according to a 2018 freedom house report
biira was charged with abetting terrorism for illegal filming of a military raid on a regional kings palace  an act punishable by death under the antiterrorism act if convicted
however a day later she was released on bail
biiras ordeal sparked condemnation on social media through hashtags such as freejoydoreen and journalismisnotacrime
this netizen criticized ugandan president yoweri musevenis tendency to silence journalists
freejoydoreen president kagutamuseveni should stop silencing journalists
that is total impunity in our continent pic

opiyo told global voices that biiras case was dropped and closed in march 2017 after authorities investigated it and found no evidence to charge her in a court of law
like many such cases one is reviewed to be free but left with a sense of unfairness injustice and pain said opiyo who is also the executive director of chapter four uganda a human rights organization
opiyo added that spending a few days in jail and enduring the pain of being locked up never leaves you
targeted online attacks
women journalists who experience abuse online rarely see justice and often struggle to have their complaints taken seriously and properly investigated
in april 2017 gertrude tumusiime uwitware a news anchor at ntv uganda defended stella nyanzi an outspoken professor who criticized the museveni administration for failing to fulfill a campaign promise to distribute sanitary pads to poor girls
authorities forced uwitware to delete her twitter and facebook posts with comments in support of nyanzi
she received threats on facebook and was then abducted by unknown assailants for at least eight hours according to a 2017 uganda human rights report
her kidnappers allegedly interrogated her about her connection with nyanzi badly bit her and cut her hair

uwitware was later found at a police station in kampala
however authorities have not released any updates on the investigation into her kidnapping
political journalists  especially those who cover opposition politics  often experience threats more than any other kind of journalism
but women journalists have it worse because the government believes they are weaker and easily intimidated according to mukose arnold anthony secretary for media safety and human rights of the uganda journalists association uja who spoke to global voices via whatsapp on april 3
when it comes to sexual harassment online female journalists fear to open upalthough a few  disclose  the majority end up dying silently anthony said
women journalists may face extra psychological harm breach of privacy loss of identity limitation of mobility censorship and loss of property as a result of their work according to a unesco study on freedom of expression in africa published in 2018
and according to a human rights network for journalistsuganda 2018 study 12 percent of women journalists have suffered abuses and violations including death threats and arrests
threequarters of women journalists suffered violations at the hands of state agents such as the police resident district commissioners and other security operatives
attacks and harassment
ugandan journalist bahati remmy has faced attacks and harassment on the job as a female reporter
photo via bahati remmy paydesk public account used with permission
bahati remmy a ugandan female journalist who now works in the united states told global voices that she quit reporting news in uganda because she felt jaded after her horrific ordeal while covering the elections in uganda in 2016
ugandan police arrested remmy while doing a live broadcast for the privatelyowned nbs tv to cover the house arrest of opposition politician dr
kizza besigye in the town of kasangati
remmy told global voices
the police engaged in a running battle not to allow any journalists to cover the story concerning besigye
police fondled her breasts in the police van undressed her at the station and exposed her naked body to a camera according to remmy
she was also followed and harassed by a police officer on facebook because the ugandan government thought she had connived with besigye to taint the countrys image
she told global voices that anonymous notes left at her door threatened to kidnap her if she refused to reveal besigyes exit route from his house
in the aftermath of remmys arrest human rights network for journalistsuganda took a poll to gauge public opinion about the ordeal
they asked uganda police claimed that nbs tv reporter bahati remmy disobeyed lawful orders and also obstructed police officers on duty hence her arrest do you agree
magambo emmanuel wrote
it is a lame excuse and total lie because there is video footage that shows how bahati was arrested
police should stop shifting their problems to innocent journalists
davide lubuurwa wrote
whoever tries to let the people know how the state is standing is to be arrested
a very big problem is coming to uganda soon
what bothers me most is that whoever tries to say something that is not in support of the current regime is taken to be a rebel so the ugandan people must wake up
many women journalists in uganda have stopped reporting stories that are critical of the government because they fear attacks and harassment by the state
media practitioners have said that government and security agents occasionally call editors and instruct them to not to publish stories that negatively portray the government
these attacks often go unreported  especially for women  which has also made it difficult to understand the full scope of this problem
remmy dragged the ugandan government to the uganda human rights commission but until today there has been no update on her case
the commission lacks the required independence to rule in favor of those who submit complaints against the government
its seven members including its chairperson are appointed by the president with the parliaments approval
they are biased remmy said adding they have a huge backlog and most of the cases they want to hear are cases brought in by the government
many threats faced by women journalists online are closely linked to abuse offline
remmy believes that the right plight and dignity of female journalists should be upheld at all times because attacks on women silence the media as a whole
as uganda plans to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021 attacks and harassment of women journalists by the state need to stop because it affects access to information freedom of expression and democracy rights of ugandan citizens
press freedom remains an undermined child in the countrys system remmy told global voices

editors note this personal essay was written following a twitter campaign organized by global voices subsaharan africa and rising voices where each week a different language activist shared their perspectives on the intersection of digital rights and african languages  as part of the project the identity matrix platform regulation of online threats to expression in africa
according to the united nations educational scientific and cultural organisation unesco linguistic and cultural diversity are of strategic importance for people around the world to strengthen the unity and cohesion of societies
this linguistic and cultural diversity propelled the unesco general conference to proclaim international mother language day imld in november 1999 to be commemorated annually on february 21 annually
to bolster imld the united nations un declared the international year of indigenous languages iyil 2019 to draw attention to the endangerment of the worlds indigenous languages

today there are over 7100 languages spoken around the world 28 percent of which are spoken on the african continent alone
despite this english dominates online spaces in the region
some twenty years ago 80 percent of the worlds online content was englishcentric
currently however english content online is said to have shrunk to between 51 55 percent

44 english
can we argue that more people are yearning to get online in their local languages and is it true that 17 m people worldwide have no reason to get online httpst

the milliondollar question therefore is could this sharp drop be an indicator that people now favor their native languages online over english considering that less than 15 percent of the world population speaks english as their first language
swahili coming to birth
swahili is recognized as one of the official languages of the african union au alongside english portuguese french spanish and arabic
swahili is also the lingua franca for east africa community eac member states
rwanda an eac member saw its lower legislative house approve a law making swahili an official language in 2017  in addition to kinyarwanda french and english
besides being used for administrative purposes swahili will be incorporated into rwandas school curriculum
in uganda the government in september 2019 approved the establishment of the national swahili council
article 6 2 of the constitution of uganda also spells out that swahili shall be the second official language in uganda to be used in such circumstances as parliament may by law prescribe
in 2018 south africa which boasts 11 official languages formalized swahili as an optional subject in its curriculum starting in 2020
in 2019 the southern africa development community sadc adopted swahili as its fourth official language

despite swahili being the most widely spoken african language with approximately 150 million speakers  mostly in east africa the great lakes region southern somalia and some parts of southern africa its visibility online is dismal
john walubengo a lecturer at the multimedia university of kenya states in an oped with the nation a kenyan daily that the absence of online linguistic and cultural diversity creates a society with a tunnelvision view of the world

walubengo predicts that most indigenous cultures end up surrendering their identities to the english way of doing things
this sad reality can only be reversed if indigenous civilizations fight to retain their identities both online and offline he says

but all is not gloom and doom
there are some dedicated organizations at the forefront of promoting and developing swahili online

the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers
icann a global multistakeholder organization that coordinates internet domain name system dns internet protocol ip addresses and autonomous system numbers instituted the internationalized domain names idns that enable people to use domain names in local languages and scripts

ideally they are formed using characters from different scripts such as arabic chinese or cyrillic
these are then encoded by the unicode standard and used as allowed by relevant idn protocols a set of standards defined by the internet architecture board iab and its subsidiary groups the internet engineering task force ietf and the internet research task force irtf
the universal acceptance steering group uasg
uasg is a communitybased team of industry leaders supported by icann that prepares online communities for the next billion internet users
this is achieved through a process known as universal acceptance ua that ensures that internet applications and systems treat all toplevel domains tlds and emails based on those domains in a consistent manner  including those in nonlatinbased languages and those that are more than three characters long
ua serves digital natives around the world in their local languages and with domain names that better align with their cultural identities
hence promoting a multilingual internet
icannwiki
this nonprofit organization provides communitydeveloped wiki on icann and internet governance has over time partnered with organizations educational institutions and individuals in kenya and tanzania
this has enabled east africans to build translate and add wiki resources in their own vision language and perspective

this swahili initiative  that i have personally been part of  has immensely bridged the information gap on internet governance issues by localizing icannwiki content to promote local engagement in the target communities
localization lab
localization lab is a global community of volunteer collaborators who support the translation and localization of digital safety tutorials and tools like tor signal ooni psiphon
these technologies address security privacy and anonymity online by ensuring that indigineous language activists have safe spaces for accessing information online
localization lab has translated more than 60 of these safety tools into over 180 different languages and dialects from around the world among them swahili
kondoa community network kcn
kcn is the first community network to pilot the use of television white space tvws a wireless technology that employs unused parts of the radio spectrum in the 470 to 790 mhz frequency band  to address internet connectivity in rural tanzania
kcn trains the rural populace to create and host local content thats befitting to their context

matogoro jabhera kcn founder and lecturer at the university of dodoma tanzania told global voices in a skype call that he believes that local content provides an incentive for more of the offline population to get online because they can relate with their local news  compared to the current situation where most contents are in the english language
the next billion multilingual users on the internet
the world anticipates connecting the next billion users of the internet and 17 million of these users are projected to get connected online using language as their digital identity
therefore a lack of sufficient local content could have adverse effects as far as digital inclusion
this will outrightly affect digital rights  largely internet access right to access information online and the right to use their own indigenous language to create share and disseminate information and knowledge through the internet
it is thus vital to put in place formidable action plans that will foster the development of ict applications and services as well as the use of local languages to guarantee digital inclusion for all
this complemented by actions such as localization of digital training and learning materials and rural ict literacy programs is likely to spur a digital revolution hence promoting digital rights of internet users and bridging the digital divide

ultimately this process will hasten the protection respect and promotion of  all african and minority languages on the internet as enunciated in the principles of the african declaration on internet rights and freedom

protesters demand the removal of thenpresident robert mugabe now deceased from power on november 18 2017
photo by flickr user zimbabweaneyes public domain
in the early morning of november 15 2017 zimbabweans woke up to the news that former strongman the late robert mugabe had been deposed in a coup detat and was under house arrest with his family at the presidential residence state house

major general sibusiso moyo now foreign affairs minister announced on state television that the president was safe under state custody and that the situation has moved to another level

almost immediately following general moyos announcement zimbabweans fervently took to social media  in particular whatsapp twitter and facebook  to get updates on the situation
this newfound popularity of social media to access information and mobilise protests took root for the first time among zimbabweans when protesters took to the streets and helped push mugabe out of office

the new government led by emmerson dambudzo mnangagwa took notice of social medias power
as a former state security minister mnangagwa also appreciated the importance and value of disinformation in zimbabwes political terrain

in a calculated move to consolidate newfound political power and ensure an electoral victory during the presidential and legislative elections scheduled for next year mnangagwa instructed his ruling zanu pf zimbabwe african national unionpatriotic front party youth league to enter the social media and online firmament and batter the opponent back in march 2018

in postmugabe zimbabwe this has exacerbated a mis and disinformation crisis leaving zimbabweans with few credible and accurate sources of information to stay informed about the countrys transition and and antigovernment protests
while the new government decried fake news pertaining to any news circulated on social media that they perceived to threaten the countrys status quo it also deployed tactics aimed at misleading the public about its handling of antigovernment protests

the bane of online free expression
zimbabwe has witnessed a significant rise in mobile internet and social media usage over the past few years
the internet penetration rate increased by 41
1 percent from 11 percent of the population to 52
1 percent between 2010 and 2018 while mobile phone penetration increased by 43
8 percent from 58
8 percent to 102
7 percent over the same period
this means that half the population is now connected to the internet compared to only 11 percent in 2010

however mis and disinformation have found fertile ground to flourish owing to a variety of factors extreme polarisation in the media proposed government controls over social media poor official communication methods and low digital literacy among internet users
during the antigovernment protests of january 2019 when state security forces arrested and beat hundreds of protesters news of these clampdowns competed with government claims of fake news or their absolute denial
the government restricted access to internet services to disrupt the flow of information and contribute to widespread confusion
they and their supporters also resorted to public misinformation about the protests and discredited any truthful information or reports as fake news

in zimbabwe citizens usually regard general statements issued by government ministers as official policy
for example deputy information minister energy mutodi sought to convince people that everything was normal and that videos and images of the military patrolling the streets were the work of a few rogue individuals
mutodi further misled the nation when he claimed on state television that there was no internet shutdown but rather a congested network
in another suspected case of possible governmentsanctioned disinformation millions of people remained cut off from social media during the january protests
others downloaded virtual private network vpn applications to stay informed but messages circulated that downloading such applications would lead to arrests creating further panic and apprehension

when in march 2019 human rights watch hrw tweeted a report denouncing the governments use of horrific violence during the january 2019 protests government supporters took to twitter to discredit and attack hrw

one user tweeted that the organization is spreading blatant lies and described hrw as neocolonial organization hired to malign innocent countries to push the uss hegemonic goals
another repeated government claims and blamed the violence on rogue elements who are trying sic destroy the image of the president

and disinformation about government policies and other events of public interest have continued well beyond the january protests
most recently ruling party zanu pf members took to twitter to misinform the public about the disappearance of dr
peter magombey acting president of the zimbabwe hospital doctors association zhda
he was abducted on september 14 2019 following the announcement of a strike in the health sector
the zanu pf secretary for youth affairs described magombey as a buffoon and an embarrassment to the profession
an account under the name of zanu pf patriots said that his abduction was fake
others disseminated false claims that doctors killed many patients because of the strike including more than 500 people in one hospital
zimbabwes historic conundrum 
media control in zimbabwe bears its origins in colonial policies of the 20th century which were tainted with violent subjugation to political authority
the ian smithled rhodesian government valued propaganda and centralised information control as a weapon of choice not only to endorse the regimes believed legitimacy but to spread disinformation about the war

the colonial government passed a plethora of laws to suppress free expression or dissent against smiths racist policies and they brutally enforced these laws to target liberation leaders
information blockades were the norm even before independence in 1980 and this set the governments tone in terms of communication policies and media management for years to come
as renowned south african journalist and writer the late heidi holland wrote in her acclaimed biography dinner with mugabe the untold story of a freedom fighter who became a tyrant
so many in zanu pfs hierarchy have lived with similar appalling violence woven into everyday life as if it were normal
the bush war or second chimurenga has never really ended in zimbabwe
today mnangagwa continues this legacy suppressing voices of critics through online disinformation tactics and internet shutdowns

this article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights through methods such as network shutdowns and disinformation during key political events in seven african countries algeria ethiopia mozambique nigeria tunisia uganda and zimbabwe
the project is funded by the africa digital rights fund of the collaboration on international ict policy for east and southern africa cipesa

in uganda the internet has become a battleground where the government attempts to silence a growing online population voicing dissent

for years ugandan authorities have deployed different tactics to stifle political dissent and keep the ruling national resistance movement party and president yoweri museveni in power

this includes blocking media websites filtering sms and shutting down social media platforms
as ugandas 2021 general election approaches authorities are expected to continue deploying similar tactics
2016 election shutdowns
during the 2016 general elections ugandan authorities resorted to shutting down entire social media platforms twice
the first shutdown took place on february 18 2016 on the eve of the presidential election and it affected social media platforms and mobile money services
the restrictions lasted for four full days
on may 11 2016 social media platforms including facebook whatsapp and twitter and mobile money transfer services were once again blocked
this shutdown lasted for one day and took place a day before president museveni was sworn in for his fifth term as president

museveni has been in power since 1986
opposition to his rule is growing according to a public opinion poll released in april 2019 an overall majority of ugandans opposed a 2017 decision to remove the maximum age limit of 75 to run for president which would allow the 74yearold to run again in the 2021 elections

during both shutdowns in 2016 the ugandan government cited national security as the motivation behind restrictions
the disruptions were ordered by ugandas security agencies and the uganda communications commission ucc which regulates the telecommunications sector online publications broadcasting both radio and television film industry postal and courier services
on february 18 2016 mtn uganda a telecommunications service provider issued a statement on twitter confirming that ucc the regulator had directed mtn to disable all social media and mobile money services due to a threat to public order and safety
this also affected other telecoms companies such as airtel smile vodafone and africel

the same day president museveni told journalists that he ordered the blocking of social media steps must be taken for security to stop so many getting in trouble it is temporary because some people use those pathways for telling lies he said
on march 17 in an official declaration during supreme court deliberations in which president musevenis 2016 victory was challenged the ucc executive director godfrey mutabazi explained that he received instructions from the inspector general of police kale kayihura to shut down social media networking sites and mobile money facilities owing to security concerns

these shutdowns interfered with the rights and daily lives of ugandans who use the internet and social media platforms to access information express views and conduct everyday business online
during the weeks prior to the 2016 elections ugandans actively tweeted and debated about the elections using hashtags like ugandadecides and ugdebate16
ugandan citizens level of online civic engagement was sparked by the firstever televised presidential debates the first of which was held in january and the second a week later

even with the social media bans in place many ugandans continued to post about the elections using virtual private networks or vpns
on election day citizens were able to share updates on late arrivals of voting materials at various stations reports of election malpractice and provisional election results on social media
human rights activists say that targeted shutdowns during election periods slow down communication just when access to information and citizen expression are most needed

internet shutdowns limit people from communicating particular concerns that affect them such as health interaction with friends as well sharing of political views and opinions moses owiny the chief executive of the center for multilateral affairs an independent platform for policy analysis operating in uganda and tanzania told global voices in an interview
according to owiny shutdowns primarily aim to stop dissent in politics based on perceived fear by the state that citizens views and concerns are likely to incite the public an accusation he believes is unfounded and not grounded in reality but assumptions
ugandas history of blocking platforms and websites
on april 14 2011 the ucc instructed isps to temporarily block access to facebook and twitter for 24 hours to eliminate connecting and sharing information
the order came in the heat of oppositionled walk to work protests over rising fuel and food prices
the regulator stated that security agencies requested the block to minimize social media use in order to prevent violence

in 2011 the elections were marked with sms filtration that contained certain words including egypt bullet and people power

in the lead up to the 2006 elections the ucc instructed isps to block access to the website of radio katwe for publishing malicious and false information against the ruling national resistance movement and its presidential candidate according to a 2015 ict policy briefing by collaboration on international ict policy for east and southern africa cipesa
ugandan authorities blocked access to the radio station and the daily monitor website for publishing independently tallied election results
media platforms were quickly reinstated but only after the electoral commission announced official results

since 2016 authorities have continued to crack down on opposition politicians and journalists

robert kyagulanyi known as bobi wine singer and leader of the opposition party people power who is also a member of parliament has already announced his bid for the presidency
wine currently faces criminal charges for annoying the president and if convicted he would not be allowed to run
according to human rights watch in 2018 authorities targeted six opposition members including bobi wine and francis zaake ahead of the august 15 byelections in arua northern uganda
members of the police and military arrested the group along with 28 other people on august 13 2018 and charged them with treason
they were later released on bail
that same day police also arrested two journalists herber zziwa and ronald muwanga as they covered the byelection and related violence including the deadly shooting by the military of bobi wines driver

as the 2021 election approaches uganda authorities are very likely to continue to crack down on political dissent including through social media shutdowns
in fact since the 2016 elections there has been no change in the legal framework that allows the government to restrict the rights to freedom of expression and access to information online
according to the 2016 state of internet freedom in africa report  the 2013 communications act gives ucc broad powers and functions under section 5 that permits the communications regulator to monitor inspect license supervise control and regulate communications services and to set standards monitor and enforce compliance relating to content
at the request of the government the ucc used this section to order isps to block access to social media and mobile money services during the 2016 elections

the government continues to weaponize these laws to control public debate and to silence political dissent particularly at times of elections

owiny argues that the state is capable of shutting down the internet at any time deemed necessary where regime security and that of its citizens converges and where regime security is threatened the regime security and its survival will take precedent

nongovernmental organizations and human rights defenders have been organizing in uganda so that shutdowns like the ones that took place in 2016 dont happen again

several organizations wrote a joint letter to the african union and regional bodies asking them to condemn the decision by ugandan authorities to shut down internet access during the 2016 elections
unwanted witness uganda took the ugandan state to court along with internet service providers and the regulator in a case filed in september 2016
the organization contended that the internet shutdown planned by the state violated the rights of ugandans to personal freedom of speech and expression is enshrined in article 291 of the 1995 constitution
however a judge ruled that the applicants failed to prove any violations that resulted from the shutdowns unwanted witness uganda told global voices

achieving uninterrupted access to the internet  particularly during the upcoming elections  will require more advocacy

owiny suggested the need for digital rights activists to deepen conversations between the government and private sector to present the negative impact of shutdowns because the private sector is intimidated by the state

uganda was among the first african countries to enact a right to information law known as the access to information act atia in 2005
the law promises to provide efficient effective transparent and accountable that will enable the public to effectively access and participate in decisions that affect them as citizens of the country
will the government meet its mandate to promote the right to access to information will it live up to its promise

after 17 years the school faces a financial crisis that threatens its closure
nearly 70 of its 80 fulltime students cant afford to pay their tuition which comes to about 13 usd per month according to an official dcma press release
while the school has received support over the years from international donors and diplomatic missions they face a gap in funding that may force them to shut their doors at the historic old customs house
without crucial funds to continue dcma students and staff fear that the soulful sounds that flow through the hallways of this iconic institution that make these islands sing  may cease
the school not only teaches and promotes traditional culture and heritage through music but its also home to a community of young musicians who seek alternatives to making a living as creatives

we have started to face a very challenging financial moment said alessia lombardo managing director of the dcma in an official dcma video
from now to the next six months we are not sure that we can guarantee the salaries to our teachers and staff
at the moment 19 master teachers and small core staff have gone without salaries for over three months as the school struggles to secure strong funding partnerships and explore sustainable funding models for a school
while the archipelago is known as a tourist destination for its pristine beaches and luxury hotels the majority of local people struggle with high unemployment even as poverty has slightly decreased according to the world bank
for 17 years the dcma has worked tirelessly to promote and protect zanzibars rich heritage and traditions through music

kidude zanzibar is home to musical genres that emerged through cultural exchange and collaboration along the swahili coast for hundreds of years
today students can learn traditional musical genres like taarab ngoma and kidumbak along with instruments like drums qanun and oud as gatekeepers  and interpreters  of culture and tradition

i know many young people who would like to study music but they cant afford the minimal tuition fee because they are poor and unemployed surri said in the dcma video

the swahili coast tells the story of epic cultural exchanges and the dcma continues this tradition through its musical collaborations
every year the school hosts an initiative called swahili encounters matching wellknown musicians hailing from africa the middle east europe and north america with dcma students to create original musical compositions within a weeklong period
at the end of the encounter the newlyformed collaboration performs at sauti za busara and many of these collaborations turn into lifetime friendships that transcend the boundaries of language and culture proving music is a universal language
dcma offers weekly live performances showcasing students talents and collaborations with visiting musicians stone town zanzibar 2019

the dcma recognizes that music empowers and unites people across cultures  and it also employs talented youth living in a struggling economy with limited job opportunities
for the 1800 students who have trained at the dcma this is the only musical home they know where they can learn and grow as professional musicians and artists
one traveler from spain who recently visited the dcma wrote on tripadvisor personally meeting the musicians was the best piece of my time on this island
as zanzibars tourism sector rapidly grows the dcma believes that music plays an essential role in the celebration preservation and promotion of swahili culture heritage and history
zanzibar is far more than its beaches and luxury hotels  its a place bursting with talent that stems from an extraordinary history of cultural connection and collaboration

on august 12 the world health organization who announced a positive development in the clinical trials of drugs being tested for the treatment of ebola in the democratic republic of congo dr of congo
who asserted that the ebola drugs showed advances that will bring patients a better chance of survival and further affirmed that two out of the four drugs being tested are more effective in treating ebola
who is the man behind the ebola cure esteemed professor jeanjacques muyembetamfum directorgeneral of the institut national de recherche biomédicale inrb dr of congo who invested a substantial part of his adult life treating the virus
while the international media has often focused heavily on the deadly contagious nature of ebola in dr of congo less has been said about the congolese scientist who discovered its cure
muyembetamfum declared we will no longer say that evd ebola virus disease is not curable
based on muyembetamfums tireless work scientists tested four drugs for ebola treatment zmapp remdesivir mab114 and regneb3
the results from the clinical trials conducted in 499 study participants showed that patients treated with regneb3 or mab114 had a greater chance of survival when compared to those treated with the two other drugs
the trials were conducted under the auspices of the institut national de recherche biomédicale inrb the dr congo ministry of health and three medical humanitarian organizations the alliance for international medical action alima the international medical corps imc and médecins sans frontières msf
the congolese scientist behind the ebola treatment
muyembetamfum has been researching ebola since its first known outbreak in dr of congo in 1976 when he became the first researcher to travel to the area of the first outbreak
dr jeanjacques muyembe director general of the institut national de recherche biomedicale in the democratic republic of congo and his team have discovered a new ebola treatment that can cure symptoms in just an hour

with this discovery people infected with ebola will now have more trust in the possibility of recovery and will be more likely to go to the hospital for treatment
now that 90 percent of their patients can go into the treatment center and come out completely cured they will start believing it and building trust in the population and community
jeanjacque muyembetamfum
why ebola treatment matters
the first recorded cases of ebola occurred in 1976 near the ebola river in dr of congo
according to the centres for disease control and prevention cdc since then the ebola virus has emerged periodically from its natural reservoir which remains unknown to infect people in africa
ebola virus outbreaks since 1976
map from the centres of disease prevention and control

between 2014 and 2016 there were more than 28600 recorded cases of ebola within west africa
according to a who 2015 report
in october 2014 senegal had one case of ebola infection and zero death
nigeria recorded 20 cases with 8 deaths
who declared nigerias curtailment of the virus as a piece of worldclass epidemiological detective work
in january 2015 mali had 8 reported cases and 6 deaths
however the most devastating cases occurred between march and june 2016 in three countries sierra leone over 14000 cases and about 4000 deaths liberia about 10000 cases and 3000 deaths guinea  3800 cases and 2500 deaths
the global narrative on ebola
ebolas ravaging of african countries generated global panic and hysteria in 2015 when two patients died in the united states and one each in spain and germany
gabyfleur böl a researcher at the federal institute for risk assessment in berlin germany identified other cases in spain germany the uk italy and switzerland
at that time an ebola infection was considered a death sentence due to the lack of an effective treatment
as  böl asserted the high mortality rate of ebola and also the sometimesexaggerated media coverage of the epidemic created hysteria around the world
this position was further corroborated by a 2017 study in which hal roberts brittany seymour sands alden fish ii emily robinson and ethan zuckerman analyzed over 109000 stories published in us mainstreamregional media and blogs between july to november 2014 with a focus on ebola coverage
they discovered that three distinct peaks in ebola coverage in the united states media and blogs occurred around july 27 september 28 and 15 october 2014
on july 27 reports broke of the first infections of american doctors in liberia
on september 30 media widely reported the infection of thomas duncan in texas as the first infection on us soil
on october 12 ebola coverage intensified with the first infection of a health care worker in the united states
after october 12 a series of other us infectionrelated events led to continuous coverage that gradually lessened in intensity over time
us media may have covered ebola so intensively because of the presence of the disease in the us
in addition with a more interconnected army of digital networks the ebola epidemic became more amplified in europe and the us
however what remains to be seen is if the discovery of a cure by an african from dr of congo to this african epidemic will also garner as much coverage as it did in 2017

press freedom has drastically deteriorated in magufulis tanzania cpj reports

it seems that for the past week authorities have been searching for a way to justify their detention of this critical freelance journalist
first they claimed erick kabenderas citizenship was in question today they have leveled drastically different charges which call into question their motive for holding him
as a journalist kabendera has been critical of president john magufulis administration and often speaks out in favor of press freedom
he has reported on tanzanias divisive politics for international and local media such as the guardian african arguments and the east african
jebra kambole kabenderas lawyer says authorities also accused kabendera of sedition for allegedly publishing an article titled john magufuli is bulldozing tanzanias freedom in the economist but this charge was later dropped

citizenship targeted as tool for repression
kabenderas family says this is not the first time the tanzanian government has questioned kabenderas citizenship
in 2013 authorities lobbed a similar charge against him but the case was later dismissed according to the citizen
kabendera felt at the time that authorities called his citizenship into question as a way to silence him
last year the citizen also reported on several other cases where the government used the citizenship question as a tool to silence critics in tanzania
aidan eyakuze executive director of twaweza a civil society organization focused on citizen voices says authorities confiscated his passport and banned him from travel while investigating eyakuzes citizenship status
two weeks prior twaweza had issued and released results from a survey called speaking truth to power citizens views on politics in tanzania
the commission for science and technology costech claimed the survey was unauthorized and threatened legal action but later dismissed the case according to the same citizen article
tanzania has in recent years introduced a series of amendments and laws that target bloggers and media civil society organizations arts and cultural organizations and academics and researchers in what is by critical observers perceived as attempts to control tanzanias narrative and stifle free speech and political dissent

i and we are all ivan golunov
banner provided by meduza used with permission
точка кипения this russian expression meaning boiling pointthe point when enough has become enoughis perhaps the best way to convey how an increasing number of russians feel about the arrest of ivan golunov
golunov a leading investigative journalist was detained on june 6 in moscow on what appear to be trumpedup charges of drug dealing and possession

golunov was arrested and initially denied access to a lawyer in violation of russian law
his lawyer confirmed he sustained serious injuries while in custody
after being taken to hospital he was discharged and placed under house arrest on june 8

the russian police initially produced photos of a drug lab allegedly found when they searched in golunovs flat but the images were later retracted
the prokremlin media outlet russia today also confirmed that the pictures were not taken in golunovs flat
the charges being leveled against golunov could lead to a 10 to 20year prison sentence

thirtysixyearold golunov works for meduza one of the few remaining independent russianlanguage online media platforms
meduza is registered in neighboring latvia but maintains an office and several journalists in moscow
golunov has led and published several investigations pointing at cases of corruption involving highranking officials

since golunovs arrest meduza has released golunovs articles under a creative commons license and has encouraged media outlets and individuals to republish the stories an initiative fully supported by global voices
among his most important reports are ones detailing how moscows deputy mayor pyotr biryukov channeled state contracts to his family and how moscows urban beautification program involved inflated budgets
the story he was working on just before his detention focused on the monopoly of funeral services in moscow

golunovs arrest has sparked a rare expression of solidarity among not only journalists activists and lawyers but also actors popular singers and figures from outside the liberal circles of moscow and saint petersburg
on june 10 three leading newspapers agreed to publish editions with identical front pages in support of golunov
the newspapers were sold out in record time
in a rather ironic uturn prokremlin media including channel one russias mostviewed tv channel are also calling for a fair investigation
june 12 marks russia day when public marches and demonstrations approved by local authorities will take place
under russian law public demonstrations require a permit
golunovs supporters have announced they will hold their own march without obtaining official permission

kremlin observers say the russian government is seeking to lift the charges against the journalist before june 20
on that day president vladimir putin whose ratings have fallen to a historical low in the country will host the direct line his annual talk show where he takes questions from citizens by telephone and online media

its been a little over 24 hours since kenyan writer binyavanga wainaina left this world but his presence and impact continues to reverberate around the globe
the outspoken openly gay writer rebuked convention and challenged the status quo triggering a literary revolution that would open the door to thousands of aspiring writers ready to change the narratives in and about africa
the writer educator and lgbtq activist binyavanga wainaina 48 passed on tuesday may 22 in nairobi kenya after a brief illness
todays got me thinking what will your life mean when its all over binyavangas death has got me thinking about who i was about five or so years ago and also who he was to us as young enthusiastic africans hungry for a different paradigm of our continent and our selves

within minutes wainainas friends followers and admirers flooded social media to swap tributes and memories while arguing which of his prolific writings had the most influence
wainaina is best known for his provocative essay how to write about africa published in granta magazine in 2006
hes also known for his 2012 memoir one day i will write about this place and the essay i am a homosexual mum published simultaneously in chimurenga and africa is a country in 2014
the essay caused a powerful stir on twitter as people tried to parse fact from fiction and subsequently time magazine named wainaina one of the top 100 most influential people in the world
in how to write about africa wainaina called out western media and the aid industry  both particularly present in nairobi  for perpetuating negative stereotypes about the continent of africa through scathing satire
never have a picture of a welladjusted african on the cover of your book or in it unless that african has won the nobel prize
an ak47 prominent ribs naked breasts use these
if you must include an african make sure you get one in masai or zulu or dogon dress
his sarcasm was dripping  a stellar scalpel writes nigerian writer nwachukwu egbunike
widely cited by academics nongovernmental organizations and aid workers the essay   also published as a small booklet  has had a profound impact on perceptions of africa and continues to circulate surprise and provoke
on its impact journalist pernille bærendtsen writes
for me this essay has followed me since i received it as a gift in 2008 by a kenyan friend
i clearly belonged to the group of people binyavanga addressed a development worker employed by a danish ngo in tanzania writing about its impact
this was at a point when the development and aid industry sharpened its rhetoric in favor of fundraising at the cost of unfolding the contrasting diversity on the ground
i had plenty of reason to feel embarrassed but i also had time to plan how to change
binyavanga later explained in the journal bidoun how this essay randomly came to life with doubleeffect by exposing and describing the insecurity of novelists ngo workers rock musicians conservationists students and travel writers who read these guidelines on how  or maybe rather how not to  write about africa they then began to ask for his approval
wainaina a son of a kenyan father and ugandan mother continued to challenge stereotypes about africa with his groundbreaking 2012 memoir one day i will write about this place
through rich searing detail he transported readers from his childhood in the 70s in kenya to his student days in south africa where he spent many years in exile
critics hailed the book as raw and honest but wainaina later admitted that hed left out an important chapter  his love life
with i am a homosexual mum wainaina became the first highprofile kenyan to come out as openly gay on social media triggering an avalanche of social opinion
considered the lost chapter from his memoir wainaina imagines coming out as gay to his dying mother
his essay was timely as a wave of antigay crusades and legislation were being proposed in uganda and later tanzania where homosexual acts remain criminalized
read more tanzanias stance on homosexuality points to an increasingly repressive political agenda
however unlike other writers who went into exile wainaina returned home and as nanjala nyabola points out for bbc on twitter that was major
for those of us who grew up with the best kenyan writers whatever that means living in exile jailed and persecuted or poor and under appreciated or censored heavily he came back and that was major
he was a complex man but i think for this he deserves endless gratitude

we must free our imaginations
while binyavanga ironically attracted admiration from the diverse international crowd he criticized at home he felt the pressure of not fitting the set frames
binyavanga demanded free space and imagination
courageously  within a growing community supportive of lgbtq  he insisted on bending those frames
in response to all the noise and pushback that same year wainaina produced we must free our imaginations a sixpart youtube series detailing his ideas on freedom and the imagination
i want to live a life of a free imagination he declared in part 1
i want this generation of young parents to have their kids see africans writing their own stories  that simple act is the most political act one can have
i want to see a continent where every kind of persons imagination does not have to look for  being allowed
i am a panafricanist i want to see this continent change
wainaina often channeled his desire for change through his literary activism education and leadership
in 2002 after winning the prestigious caine prize for his essay discovering home he used the award money to cofound kwani a literary magazine promoting new voices and new ideas emerging from across the continent
kwani evolved over time into a publishing house and literary network that connected emerging and established writers from lagos to nairobi mogadishu to accra

while he unapologetically shook kenyan social convention  coming out as gay and later revealing his hiv status on twitter on world aids day in 2016  it often came with backlash struggle and pain
wainaina was a controversial person who struggled with depression and often wrestled with his complicated role as a public figure
he had his fans but he also faced critics like prominent kenyan writer shailja patel who accused wainaina of toxic lesbophobia
twitter user néo músangi grapples with the fallibility of wainainas character in this tweet

his style was a transgression
beautiful and freeing transgression
the people we obsess over because of their work and ideas are people after all
they are human
are we ever ready to love them in their complexity
by now a lot has been said about him
theres no need to repeat what has been said
reminders of harm that he supported have been sounded
this doesnt take away the pain one feels about his death
there is only one binyavanga wainaina
he is an ancestor now
let us celebrate his life
a creative genius
a queer icon binya  as he is fondly called   often received torrents of vitriolic antigay rhetoric that only spiked online as the news of his death spread across various channels
kenyan activist boniface mwangi wrote on twitter that after writing a facebook tribute to wainaina hateful homophobic comments derailed his message  wainaina was a creative genius who must be remembered

now that hes among the stars you can join planet binya with a full archive of his work
front page of newspaper jornal de angola on the tender won by the company telstar
taken by dércio tsandzana 19 april 2019 and used with permission
the angolan president joão lourenço cancelled on 18 abril the public tender for the fourth mobile phone operator in the country arguing that the winner telstar did not meet the necessary requirements to deliver the service
the presidents decision could indicate divisions in the angolan government
the company telstar was created in january 2018 with a capital stock of 200000 kwanza around 600 us dollars and its shareholders are the general manuel joão carneiro 90 per cent and the businessman antónio cardoso mateus 10 per cent according to the portuguese newspaper observador
manuel joão carneiros rank was awarded by the previous president josé eduardo dos santos according to the angolan online news outlet club net
the observador reported that 27 companies participated in the tendering process opened by the ministry of telecommunications and information technology under josé carvalho da rocha
on 25 april joão lourenço signed an order which establishes new rules for opening the new invitation to tender according to the newspaper jornal de angola
after the results of the first tender were made public many angolans questioned the integrity of the process
some for example highlighted that winner telstar did not even have a website
skit van darken an editor and event organizer said on facebook
a telstar  telecomunicações lda constituída a 26 de janeiro de 2018 com capital de 200
000 kwanzasde acordo com o diário da república cujos accionistas são o general manuel joão carneiro 90 do capital na reforma e antónio cardoso mateus 10
o accionista maioritário tem ligações à empresa mundo startel uma sociedade de capitais anónimos registada na inacom o regulador das telecomunicações com licença de telefonia fixa entretanto expirada
uma empresa que nem se quer website tem
eu não acredito se quer que existiram outros concorrentes
esse país é uma desgraça
telstar  telecommunications ltd formed on 26 january 2018 with capital of 200000 kwanzas according to the newspaper diário da república whose shareholders are the general manuel joão carneiro 90 per cent of the capital in retirement and antónio cardoso mateus 10 per cent
the majority shareholder has links to the company mundo startel a limited liability company registered at inacom the telecommunications regulator with a landline licence although expired
a company that doesnt even have a website
i dont even believe that there were other competitors
this country is a disgrace
meanwhile joaquim lunda a journalist and frequent social media commentator praised the presidents action and even thought that the minister in question ran the risk of being fired for these failings
agradeço e é de louvar a decisão tomada pelo presidente da república joão lourenço em anular o concurso público que atribuiu à empresa angolana telstar a licença para a quarta operadora de telecomunicações em angola
havia muitas reticências e muitos pontos por esclarecer no assunto
não se reconhece idoneidade numa empresa que foi criada em 2018 c capital social de 200 mil kwanzas em ser lhe atribuído a tal empreitada
tenho a plena certeza que os dias do ministro das telecomunicações e das tecnologias de informação josé carvalho de rocha estão contados
após o desaire que foi o angosat 1 agora mais este que testemunhamos hoje duvido se o dread vai resistir
apreciemos os cenáriosnas calmas
i appreciate and it is praiseworthy the decision taken by the president of the republic joão lourenço to annul the public tender which awarded the angolan company telstar the licence for the fourth telecommunications operator in angola
there were many reservations and a lot of points to clarify around the issue
one doesnt see the aptitude in a company which was created in 2018 with capital stock of 200 thousand kwanzas to be awarded such an undertaking
i am completely certain that the days of the minister of telecommunications and information technology josé carvalho de rocha are numbered
after the failure of angosat 1 now also this that we witness today i doubt if dread will make it
lets enjoy the show calmly
the presidents decision came after the same minister led the project in 2017 for the satellite angosat 1 also characterized by problems
for adriano sapiñala a deputy of angolas biggest opposition party the case shows disorganization within the government
jlo tem de andar a combinar bem com os seus auxiliares porque ontem o ministro de tutela dizia que o tempo das reclamações tinha terminado e por isso a telstar teria avançado com os passos subsequentes sendo ela vencedora do concurso fraudulento e hoje jlo vem e anula o concurso vocês comunicam assim tão mal
agora ou o ministro coloca o seu cargo à disposição demitindode ou então jlo tem de o exonerar porque se anulou o concurso é porque não correu bem e para não beliscar ninguém inocente que se apurem responsabilidades
jlo joão lourenço has to organize his team well because yesterday the minister responsible was saying that the time for complaints had ended and so telstar would have gone ahead with its next steps given that it was the winner of the fraudulent tender and today jlo comes and annuls the tender you communicate so badly
now either the minister makes his position available resigning or then jlo has to fire him because if he cancelled the tender it is because it did not go well and to not affect anybody innocent they need to establish responsibility

kovács and translated by anita kőműves for the hungarian investigative journalism nonprofit atlatszo
this edited version appears here as part of a partnership with global voices
hungarian progovernment media outlets have launched new attacks against blanka nagy a high school student who has spoken out against the government at several protests since late 2018
nagy has endured criticism of her intellect and even sexual harassment with one outlet calling her a whore
she has already filed and won defamation cases against three progovernment outlets that claimed she was failing in school lokál ripost and origo
however after nady won her case against origo the outlet launched another attack publishing her school reports
nagy told atlatszo that she is considering suing origo again over these latest stories
blanka nagy became wellknown in hungary last winter after she gave a speech at an antigovernment rally in which she criticized prominent politicians using foul language
her harsh words resonated with many social media users and a video of her speech went viral
about two months after her video became a social media sensation the progovernment media and pundits such as zsolt bayer launched a series of attacks against her
progovernment outlets claimed that she was failing many of her subjects in school and that she had missed many days of school
they also called her an untalented wannabe actress and a whore
her attorney filed copies of her academic transcript with the court to prove that she is not failing her classes  and thus the school transcripts became available for attorneys of origo
the outlet decided to publish data from her transcripts claiming that nagy almost failed history last term and is on the verge of failing in a few other subjects as well
when hungarys progovt media lied about teenage protester blanka nagy she sued for defamation and won
ordered to issue corrections however theyve refused and doubled down
tv2 devoted a whole news segment to mocking her grades mentioning court documents but not its ruling httpst
comyllwb2jwh
joost almodozo april 5 2019
my attorney and i are considering suing the outlet that published my school transcript nagy told atlatszo in an interview
she says that origo had no right to publish the transcripts
she and her attorney did not even think that origo had the right to see the transcripts when they filed them in court
and their latest claims are not true either she said
i am not failing my history class contrary to what they say
i have a much better grade than a 2 rough equivalent to a c
what they say is simply false
i would be ashamed if it was true because i have a history teacher among my ancestors she said
i think all this verbal aggression against me is very strange but i am no longer bothered by it
it only proves that i somehow scared the highest ranks of governing party fidesz
the fact that zsolt bayer himself attacked me and the progovernment media is using false pretexts to try and smear me proves that she added
blanka nagy high schooler fidesz is a disgusting treacherous ugly  infectious plague
this disgusting band of thievesthis oligarchgovernment are filling their pockets for their old days while you will suffer in poverty as a pensioner
she told the truth
this is hungary

defamation and disinformation are common weapons of hungarian progovernment media
some opposition figures have responded by suing these outlets for character assassination
according to data recently obtained by atlatszo the most prominent propaganda outlets have lost dozens of cases and were mandated by the courts to issue corrections to their stories 109 times during 2018

since mass protests against president daniel ortega erupted in nicaragua in april 2018 the government has banned demonstrations arrested thousands without trial and shut down both alternative and mainstream media outlets
as attempts at dialogue have so far failed the future of nicaragua remains an open question
the demonstrations were originally against a social security reform that would raise income taxes while reducing pension benefits
the initial crackdown by the authorities paved the way for a nationwide call for the resignation of president daniel ortega and first lady and vicepresident rosario murillo
figures given for the protests death toll vary and have not been updated since last year as barriers to documentation efforts increase
in december 2018 the government closed down several ngos that were keeping track of police violence and human rights abuses including the nicaraguan center for human rights cenidh and the institute for the development of democracy ipade

also in december two groups set up by the interamerican commission for human rights iachrthe special followup mechanism for nicaragua meseni and the interdisciplinary group of independent expertswere expelled from the country leaving nicaragua virtually without independent human rights observers and opening a new stage in the repression according to nicaraguan feminist activist and educator maría teresa blandón

the lowest estimate of the casualties acknowledged by the government in august 2018 amounted to 197
amnesty international however has estimated that there have been 322 deaths as of 18 september 2018 most of them caused by gunshots to the head neck and torso
blogger ana siú wrote recently on medium about her experience of the april 2018 protests
a través de una transmisión en vivo en instagram vi a una amiga de la universidad ser atacada por turbas
escuché cómo ella gritaba y luchaba por no salir lastimada  finalmente el motorizado la soltó pero se llevó consigo el celular sin saber que seguía transmitiendo
entonces dijo vamooos vamooos
hay que llevar estos celulares a revisarlos
esto siguió como por 20 minutos

i saw a friend from university being attacked by a mob through instagram live
i heard her scream and struggle to avoid being hurt  finally the man in the motorcycle that had attacked her let her go but he took her phone
he didnt realize he was still live
then he said lets go we have to take these phones to be checked
this went on for 20 minutes
she also reflects on the protest of may 30 a historic rally held on the date nicaragua celebrates mothers day where 15 people were killed
este día cambió la forma en que vivíamos las protestas
los que estábamos en esa marcha multitudinaria vimos cómo asesinaron a jóvenes
fue la primera vez que atacaron con balas de plomo a una marcha masiva
nunca me había sentido tan cerca de la muerte como esa tarde
that day the way we saw the protests change
those of us who were in that massive protest saw how they killed young people
it was the first time they had attacked a mass protest with bullets
i had never felt so close to death
while students barricaded themselves in universities in the capital managua rural workers blocked roads in the countryside
in june protesters in masaya declared the eastern city a dictatorshipfree territory
the government cracked down on these protesters who built in barricades to defend themselves and respond to police attacks
demonstrators increasingly engaged in more violent methods and confrontations which resulted in the death of 22 police officers as of august 2018 according to government data
in mid2018 the police deployed the socalled operación limpieza cleanup operation to dismantle barricades and prosecute suspected participants
reports say that law enforcement acted in cooperation with paramilitary groups
many students leaders of peasant movements rights defenders and journalists were targeted in smear campaigns and persecuted and some were charged with terrorism
even health professionals who treated people injured in the riots suffered consequences
the nicaraguan medical association said at least 240 such professionals were fired from public hospitals and clinics in retaliation

in september protests were made essentially illegal as all street activities now require advance permission from the authorities which is often denied
on february 27 2019 dialogue was resumed between the government and the opposition party alianza cívica por la justicia y la democracia civic alliance for justice and democracy following the release of a hundred people from prison
unlike previous attempts at dialogue however this one did not include leaders of peasant movements and students as some of them are incarcerated and others are in exile

not just a new president a new beginning
as the countrys crisis enters its second year the urgency and anxiety about nicaraguas future is conveyed through the hashtag sosnicaragua which is deployed daily in conjunction with allegations pictures of victims and accounts of students in prison and their families

nicaraguan news outlet niú interviewed nicaraguans who held a protest in february in neighboring costa rica and they shared accounts of the difficulties of life in exile
alejandro donaire a student who says he fled the country after participating in a peaceful protest told niú how difficult it was to feel part of a functioning society in a normal life after spending so much time hiding fleeing or protesting
madelaine caracas spokesperson of the student group known as the student coordination for democracy also shared with niú her aspirations for transformation in nicaragua which go beyond ortegas departure
tenemos que erradicar autoritarismos machismos caudillismo y demás males que han penetrado en la cultura política del país  ahora más que nunca estamos seguros de que ortega se va este año  este año estaré en nicaragua y tengo esa seguridad porque ortega está ahogado internacionalmente está ahogado económicamente y también porque la parte insurreccionada que se levantó en abril está hoy más que nunca más organizada
we need to eradicate authoritarianism sexism personal autocracy and other ills that have penetrated the political culture of the country  we believe more than ever that ortega will leave this year  that i will return to nicaragua this year
and i have the certainty because ortega is out of air internationally and economically and also because those who participated in the uprising last april are now more organized than ever
this last round of dialogues between government and opposition came to an end on april 3 with agreements reached on two of the four topics discussed
the government has pledged firstly to release all political prisoners and secondly to respect civil liberties
there were no agreements made regarding justice for the victims of violence or the expediting of the 2021 elections
opposition group civic alliance pointed out however that the government has so far failed to honor the agreements
police repression of peaceful protests has reportedly continued
as of april 6 only 50 out of over 600 political prisoners had been released and those that were were placed under house arrest

later on april 17 following new threats of sanctions from the united states over 600 prisoners were released to complete their sentences under house arrest though but according to civic alliance only 18 members of the group were on the list of political prisoners they had hoped to see out of jail
in the minds of people like activist and researcher felix madariaga the new leaders of nicaraguas future remain in prison today
meanwhile opposition groups are calling for protests commemorating the anniversary of the events of april 2018
with the refusal of authorities to grant permission to the demonstration new police crackdowns are anticipated

the video shares images of the protests that took place in the south west of the country earlier in april
indigenous afrocolombian and farming communities are staging mass protests around colombia against president ivan duques national development plan
the plan comprises an array of directives that among other things will encourage foreign investment in largescale mining and agribusiness which could threaten indigenous territories
in march 2019 indigenous communities shut down a major highway in the cauca region for 25 days
on april 25 they were joined by other social movements in leading a national strike
besides threats to indigenous rights strikers have protested against budgets cuts in education and the slow implementation of the 2016 peace accords  of which duque whos still to complete a year in office is an outspoken critic
indigenous peoples have referred to the demonstrations as mingas a quechua word meaning collective work widely used in protest movements in south america

nationalstrike  indigenous communities farmers and afros of tado are mobilizing from the early hours of the morning all along the highway from pereira to quibdo as part of the national strike itsworthittoprotest
the national development plan includes reforms in different sectors such as education energy and agriculture
while duque claims the programs will lift 34 million colombians out of poverty critics counter that it benefits primarily private corporations
indigenous minga leaders are particularly concerned with the aspects of the plan that might challenge their right to prior consultation on development projects on their territories
while the government has agreed to negotiate with indigenous leaders about the plan a final agreement is yet to be reached
according to the newspaper el espectador the amount of land the government is willing to protect on behalf of indigenous peoples are way below of what the communities demand
la diferencia entre lo que ofrece el gobierno de iván duque y lo que piden las comunidades indígenas para despejar la vía panamericana es abismal
el ejecutivo habla de 1 500 hectáreas para resolver las necesidades de todas las organizaciones que integran la minga mientras que el requerimiento de los organizadores de la protesta es de 40 000 hectáreas
the difference between what iván duques government offers and what the indigenous communities are asking for in order to open the panamericana highway is abysmal
the president talks about 1500 hectares to resolve the needs of all the organizations that make up the minga whereas the requirements of the organizations that are protesting is 40000 hectares
peace accords
signed between former president juan manuel santos and the leaders of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia the countrys largest guerrilla group the 2016 peace accords ended the countrys fivedecade internal conflict by proclaiming a definitive ceasefire in exchange for participation by former farc members in institutional politics
the peace accords have also created protections to prevent the accumulation of land by individuals and foreign companies in rural areas
it prioritized land redistribution and designated a few areas for indigenous afrocolombian and farming communities who have been severely affected by the long conflict
unequal land ownership in rural areas was a major reason why farc group took up arms in the 1960s
however full implementation of the agreement has remained elusive as many conservative sectors in colombia are staunchly against those terms
meanwhile smaller armed groups remain active in the countryside where they have staged deadly disputes for control over farcs former territories
as a consequence the number of killed social leaders in rural areas has skyrocketed since the accords signature
while figures vary depending on how a social leader is defined the colombian ombudsmans office says 460 social leaders have been killed between 2016 and march 31 2019
duque along with his main ally former president álvaro uribe is among the most prominent detractors of the peace agreement
in recent months he has attempted to weaken the authority of the special jurisdiction for peace jep a judicial body created by the accords to try both guerrilla and government actors suspected of war crimes
many groups are outraged at those measures which they say could undermine the chances of true reconciliation
people shared their reasons for joining the april 25 strike with the hashtag vamosalparopor we are going to strike for and minganacionalporlavida national minga for life

the journalist states
la minga nos recuerda que eso no es el único lugar donde viven incumpliendo la gente y le hacen pistola cada vez que pueda
vemos cuatro regiones del país que el estado ignora por completa
the minga reminds us that it is not the only place where people live with unfulfilled promises with the government flicking them off every time it can
we see four regions of the country that the state ignores completely
no definite solution has been given to the mingas and strikers demands so protests are likely to continue in the coming months

5 percent of internet connections became inactive sending the west african country into a nationwide internet shutdown that lasted well into the night
human rights groups and election monitors were dismayed but not shocked by the outage which appears to have been orchestrated by the sitting government
new electoral laws pushed by the incumbent administration of president patrice talon have reoriented politics in benin which until this year had multiple political parties competing with one another
but under new policies that raise the threshold for party participation in elections only two political parties made the cut to put up candidates for parliamentary election
both parties are closely aligned with the president
in the leadup to the election a series of public protests  which took place despite a blanket ban on street protests  were dispersed by law enforcement officials who used tear gas and batons to break up demonstrations
amnesty international reported that multiple political opposition leaders were arrested during demonstrations
open web activists at the media foundation for west africa internet sans frontieres cipesa access now global voices subsaharan africa and other groups condemned the shutdown in a joint statement
the un human rights committee the official interpreter of the international covenant on civil and political rights emphasizes in general comment no
34 that restrictions on speech online must be strictly necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate purpose
7 shutdowns by contrast disproportionately impact all users and unnecessarily restrict access to information and emergency services communications during crucial moments
shutdowns are neither necessary to nor effective at achieving a legitimate aim as they often spread confusion and encourage more people to join public demonstrations

we respectfully call on you to
ensure that social media is restored  
publicly declare your commitment to keep the internet on and to notify the public of any disruptions
encourage telecommunications and internet services providers to respect human rights through public disclosures on policies and practices impacting users
speaking with internet sans frontieres beninese writer and activist mylène flicka of irawo media noted
shutting down the internet on election day only adds suspicion to an already flawed electoral process
benin is now performing very poorly in terms of democracy

allforjan demonstration in memory of murdered journalist ján kuciak and his fiancée martina kušnírová in bratislava 2 march 2018
photo by peter tkac cc bysa
businessman marián kočner has been charged with ordering the killing of journalist ján kuciak and his fiancée martina kušnírová in 2018 according to a march 15 announcement by slovakias special prosecutions office
before he was killed kuciak was working with the organized crime and corruption reporting project occrp and his outlet aktuality
sk to investigate possible links between an italian criminal group and its presence in slovakia
he also wrote about the business dealings of kočner
the murders caused widespread shock in the country
demands for justice led to massive protests which forced the resignation of then prime minister robert fico
kuciak was the real target while kušnírová was killed for simply being in their house when the killers barged in
they were both 27 years old and had planned to marry in may 2018
according to the prosecution kočner personally threatened kuciak by phone in september 2017 and then ordered the murder that took place on 21 february 2018 in the village of veľká mača
slovak law enforcement initially detained four people for the killing of kuciak and kušnírová
kočners assistant alena zsuzsová was accused of paying 50000 euros about us 57000 in cash and the forgiveness of more than 20000 euros about us 22700 in debt to three people  a pizza parlor owner a former police officer and a former soldier  to organize and commit the murder
during the summer kočner was arrested for financial crimes investigated by kuciak but it took authorities six more months to arrest the subordinates of the controversial entrepreneur and directly connect him to the assassination plot
the reason for the murder was the journalistic work of the victim a special prosecutor who was left unnamed for security reasons told reporters at a march 15 news conference near bratislava

this is a significant step and a rare one in murders of journalists
we hope authorities keep their promise to bring all perpetrators to justice thereby making all journalists in slovakia safer from violence
harlem desir from the organization for security and cooperation in europe also noted
i commend todays indictment against instigator of murder of journalist jankuciak in slovakia

in may 2018 kuciak was posthumously awarded the inaugural award for journalists whistleblowers and defenders of the right to information by the european united leftnordic green left guengl in the eu parliament
named for slain maltese journalist daphne caruana galizia the award is intended to recognize the work and courage of individuals in exposing corruption and wrongdoing by the powerful
continuing ján kuciaks legacy
after kuciak was murdered occrp and its member centers completed and published some of his unfinished research
in february 2019 they released a report based titled unfinished lives unfinished justice
this was compiled by occrp the investigative reporting project italy investigace
cz and the investigative centre of ján kuciak icjk based on kuciaks reporting about organized crime in slovakia and its ties to politics and law enforcement
but icjk revealed via twitter how some authorities were not cooperating with them and that they were prevented from attending the press conference announcing the indictment of kočner
today at 1300 a press conference to the investigation of martina and jans murder will be held at the special prosecutors office
we will not be there
according to the prosecution we are not journalists just a curious public who can read it in the paper

despite the fact that authorities have now charged the alleged mastermind of the killing journalists and media advocates insist there are still unresolved questions related to the case such as the rumored involvement of prominent politicians
in particular advocates are interested in learning what the former prime minister fico and robert krajmer former head of the anticorruption unit of the slovak national crime agency may have known about the murders
friends and family of kuciak and kušnírová have already asked authorities to investigate the ties of newly indicted kočner with powerful officials that protected him over the last two decades
kušnírovás family lawyer is worried that kočners close friendship with slovakias former general prosecutor dobroslav trnka could affect the progress of the case

mk set up by the government of republic of north macedonia on occasion of the popes visit on 7 may 2019
pope francis will visit north macedonia in may 2019 just two days after the second round of presidential elections
it will be the first time a pope visits north macedonia
the visit is part of a threeday regional tour which will also include a stop in bulgaria
the government of north macedonia has set up a website papa
mk to facilitate the visit
in line with the multicultural character of the country the website contents are available in three languages macedonian albanian and english
some citizens have questioned the governments ownership of the website claiming that it contradicts the countrys secular character
macedonian citizens can apply for tickets to the pontiffs holy mass which are free of charge through local churches while foreigners must secure their places through the website
the mass will take place at the main square of the capital skopje on may 7
catholics make up less than one percent of the population of north macedonia where about 65 percent have professed faith for orthodox christianity and about 33 percent are muslim
despite its small size the local catholic community is considerably diverse as it includes ethnic macedonians albanians croats slovenes and poles
on the other hand the country has religious significance for catholicism because the capital skopje is the birthplace of mother theresa 19101997 officially honored as saint theresa of calcutta
one of the most popular missionaries of the 20th century and a recipient of the nobel peace prize she was born in an ethnic albanian family whose house was situated precisely on what is now the main town square
the political aspect of the visit surpasses its religious significance
as a head of state the pontiff is scheduled to meet the prime minister and the outgoing president whose mandate will end five days afterward
the macedonian public appears to see the visit as a sign of recognition by the west and a boost to the governments efforts to bring the country closer to membership of nato and the european union
such sentiment is apparent in a tweet from retired police general stojanche angelov who commented on the preparatory visit by the chief of macedonian public safety bureau to the vatican

senator gustavo petro who lost presidential elections in 2010 and 2018 also participated in the march through his organization colombia humana human colombia
a video by adriaan alsema the founder of online media outlet colombia reports shows some images of previous protests that were staged inside and outside colombia against the killings of social leaders
it also includes a brief explanation of the problem
over 163  community leaders and activists  referred under the umbrella term líderes sociales in colombia  have been murdered over the past three years in colombia according to the uns high commissioner for human rights
the colombian ombudsman has a much higher figure  over 460 killings since 2016
by any accounts the number of violent deaths has soared since the 2016 peace agreement that for the most part ended the countrys decadeslong conflict between the government and the guerrilla group farc
among many other directives the peace agreement stipulates that the farc will surrender all assets in exchange for participation in institutional politics
but the farc has left a vacuum of power since it left its former territories which have now been occupied either by paramilitary groups or guerrilla dissidents that dont accept the peace process
social leaders are targeted for defending their communities from such groups who usually run a monopoly on illegal drug trade or illegal mining on the areas they control
according to carlos guevara who coordinates the organization somos defensores we are defenders in spanish the social leaders are often killed in their own homes in front of their families and usually have no support from authorities when they seek justice
las agresiones contra personas que se dedican a defender de los derechos humanos en colombia está al nivel de una crisis humanitaria  los están matando porque están impulsando quitar una economía considerada ilegal y que beneficia a los narcotraficantes y grupos armados
y el gobierno no está tomando medidas para proteger a esos líderes
aggressions against people devoted to defend human rights in colombia has reached the level of a humanitarian crisis  theyre being killed because theyre pushing to move away from an economy deemed illegal and beneficial to drug traffickers and armed groups
the government is not taking action to protect these leaders
meanwhile the national conference of afrocolombian organizations highlights an important aspect of the mass killings that tends to be set aside the fact that most social leaders belong to ethnic minorities
in addition female leaders suffer from an additional layer of violence as they are subjected to additional kinds of genderbased aggressions
colombia twitter often uses the hashtag nosestánmatando theyre killing us to talk about the killings of social leaders
with the icc march activists hope to raise the international profile of their plight
meanwhile the numbers dont cease to soar
since the start of 2019 73 social leaders have been threatened just in the central boyacá department

ould mkhaitir was sentenced to death in 2014 over an opinion piece published online
despite having his death sentence commuted more than a year ago mauritanian blogger mohamed cheikh ould mkhaitir is still in prison
ould mkhaitir was sentenced to death in 2014 over an opinion article published on the website of the newspaper aqlame
in the article entitled religion religiosity and craftsmen ould mkhaitir criticised the role of religion in mauritanias caste system using stories from the lifetime of prophet muhammad to support his argument
the original article has since been taken down by aqlame but is still available online
a court convicted him of apostasy and sentenced him to death under article 306 of the mauritanian penal code
in april 2016 a court of appeal upheld his sentence and referred his case to the supreme court which then returned it to the appeal court for procedural irregularities
in november 2017 his death sentence was commuted and reduced to two years in jail and a fine by the court of appeal
however despite having already served more than two years in prison the authorities did not release ould mkhaitir
almost 18 months after the appeal courts decision to release him he remains behind bars
on april 24 2019 mauritanias justice minister said that mkhaitir was in temporary detention and that only the supreme court can rule on his fate
article 306 of the penal code previously provided that if the convicted person repents before his or her execution the mauritanian supreme court could commute the death sentence to a jail sentence of between three months and two years and a fine
but in april 2018 the mauritanian national assembly passed a law making the death penalty mandatory for anyone convicted of blasphemous speech and acts deemed sacrilegious
the timing of the enactment of the law just a few months after the court of appeal ordered mkhaïtirs release appears to be related to his case human rights watch said in november 2018
critiques of racism and the caste system are taboo in mauritania and have spurred many political and legal threats against journalists and activists in recent years
in 1981 mauritania became the last country on earth to officially abolish slavery and only criminalized the practice in 2007
but since that time un officials and human rights workers have documented evidence that thousands of people many of them ethnic haratines of black african origin are still enslaved living in situations of forced labour or otherwise facing castebased discrimination
the mauritanian government denies that slavery still exists in the country and many people like ould mkhaitir who speak out against the practice and discrimination against haratines have been jailed and prosecuted
last september authorities jailed and charged activist abdallahi salem ould yali with incitement to violence and racial hatred for posting messages in whatsapp group denouncing the plight and the marginalisation of his community
shawkan enjoying a day out before he is locked again for the night
photo taken by wael abbas and posted on the photojournalists twitter account
egyptian photojournalist mahmoud abu zeid also known as shawkan spent five years in prison for simply doing his job as a journalist

he was detained on august 14 2013 as he was photographing the deadly dispersal of the rabaa el adaweya sitin in which supporters of former egyptian president mohamed morsi gathered to protest a military coup that ended his presidency on july 3 that same year
egyptian security forces killed at least 817 people and injured many more according to human rights watch when they dispersed the sitin
shawkan who was working for demotix at the time of his arrest spent almost four years in pretrial detention before his trial along with 739 other defendants in what came to be known as the rabaa dispersal case began
in september 2018 a cairo criminal court convicted him on spurious charges of murder and affiliation with the muslim brotherhood and a few months later he was released from jail

shawkans supporters were thrilled to see him reunited with his loved ones when he was released on march 4
but the journalist is actually only partially free
every evening at 6pm he has to report to his local police station where he has to spend the night before he is free again at 6am the following morning
shawkan needs to do this every day for five years after his release

i want to be free so i can return to normal life shawkan told deutsche welle after his release in reference to his probation period

on twitter and instagram the journalist has been reflecting and posting about his life under these restrictive conditions and his daily hours of freedom from 6am to 6pm

on march 31 he posted about his visit to the pyramids in giza

a trip nearby the place of supervision police station where he has to spend the night because of the lack of time
on april 6 using the hashtag نص_حرية half freedom in english he posted a photo on instagram taken from his seat on a motorcycle
he explained that in order to arrive to the police station on time each night he travels by motorcycle so he can avoid traffic
shawkans story is not unique in egypt
prominent egyptian blogger and activist alaa abd el fattah who was released from jail on march 28 is also under a similar probation period
alaa spent five years in jail for defying a protest ban and like shawkan he has to spend the night at a police station for the next five years
freedom for alaa
since his release alaa has been speaking out against the conditions of his probation
photo by the freedom for alaa campaign
alaa has also been reflecting on life under probation
i am happy to see your joy over my release but i am unfortunately not free alaa wrote on facebook days after his release
every day i surrender myself to a humiliation called police monitoring
in another post he wrote i do not know how to describe the beautiful feeling of seeing his son khaleds swimming lesson for the first time
i also dont know how to describe the cruelty of leaving him in midlesson to be on time for the monitoring
alaas sister mona seif who is also a human rights activist likened the conditions of her brothers imprisonment every night to solitary confinement
alaa has to turn himself in to dokki police station every day at 6 pm and they let him go at 6 am
when he turns himself in they keep him isolated from all others in a small wooden kiosk within the police station
they lock him in for 12 hrs

these are worst conditions than the ones he had to endure in prison for five years
alaa is practically now spending half his day in solitary confinement in the police station and he is looking at five years more of this nightmare
alaa has also learned that speaking out against these conditions can pose a risk of additional jail time
on the night of april 9 security officers threatened to throw him back in jail if he keeps exposing the conditions of his probation
ahmed maher a political activist with the april 6 youth movement spent three years behind bars for illegal demonstration
he was released in january 2017 and placed under police monitoring a period equal to the amount of time he spent in jail
on twitter he described the conditions of this period
في المراقبة بيكون مكان النوم أكثر قذارة من السجن والتعسف بيكون اكتر رغم إن بالقانون مش من حقهم يحبسونا في القسم ولا يحرمونا من عيالنا وشغلنا ودراستنا وحياتنا الطبيعية
بالقانون ممكن المراقبة تكون ألطف وأكثر آدمية لكن واضح إن المحرك هو الرغبة في التنكيل والإذلال ليس إلا

under police monitoring where we sleep is much dirtier than in prison and there is more arbitrariness even though according to law they do not have the right to imprison us in a police station or to deprive us of our children our work our studies and our normal lives
according to law monitoring should be more gentle and more humane but it is clear that the motivation is nothing but a desire to abuse and humiliate
this practice of locking former prisoners overnight is an abuse of power
according to legal analysts and human rights ngos those placed under monitoring are supposed to be able to spend the night in their homes
only those who are without a place to live in the area of their local police station are required to spend the night in official custody
yasmin omar and mai elsadaby of the tahrir institute for middle east policy wrote
after an individual is sentenced to a probation period decided by the judge at sentencing the law empowers the sentenced individual to designate a residence at which to serve his or her probation period
however the law additionally authorizes authorities to select a location for probation if no residence is provided as well as to determine whether or not a location selected by the defendant is appropriate for police surveillance
this discretion has been used to systematically erode the right of individuals to complete their probation periods at their stated residencea right guaranteed to them under lawand instead force individuals who have residences where police surveillance can clearly occur to spend them at police stations
yet at the end of each day many egyptians are forced to retreat to a small cell in a police station away from their loved ones and the rest of the world they are out of prison but not really free
many are activists protesters and journalists whose only crimes were to exercise their fundamental rights to freedom of expression assembly and protest
army officers on patrol in rio de janeiro in 2018
image tânia rêgoagência brasil republication permitted with attribution
on april 7 a sunday musician evaldo dos santos rosa 51 was on his way to a baby shower in guadalupe a poor neighborhood in the city of rio de janeiro
in the car with him were his fatherinlaw his wife their 7yearold son and a friend
the sun was up and it seemed like a regular weekend in brazils largest coastal city
as they drove by an army compound nearby soldiers fired a hail of bullets towards the car
evaldo was killed on the spot while his fatherinlaw along with a passerby that was near the scene were injured
the other passengers managed to escape
the police which inspected the scene later revealed the car was shot 80 times
leonardo salgado police chief said he believed the officers mistook evaldos car to another one used by criminals which they were after according to news website g1
he added that police didnt find any weapons on evaldos car
luciana nogueira evaldos wife of 27 years who survived the shooting told estado de s
paulo
os vizinhos começaram a socorrer o meu marido mas eles continuaram atirando
eu botei a mão na cabeça pedi socorro disse pra eles que era meu marido mas eles não fizeram nada ficaram de deboche
the neighbors started to help my husband but the soldiers kept shooting
i put my hands on my head cried for help told them that he was my husband but they didnt do anything the just stood there with debauchery
while the brutal murder of an innocent man by state officials has shocked brazil president jair bolsonaro remained silent about the incident for six days
when he finally spoke at a press conference on april 12 he said the army didnt kill anyone the army is of the people and you cant accuse the people of murder
previously the only words that came out of planalto palace the executives seat was through the presidents spokesperson who referred to evaldos execution as an incident without offering condolences to his family
in the evening of april 8 rio de janeiros state governor wilson witzel an ally of bolsonaro declared that it wasnt up to him to make a judgment
two days later minister of justice and public security sergio moro only said the killing was unfortunate during an interview to a tv show
número de menções no twitter do primeiro escalão do governo bolsonaro ao fuzilamento de um carro de família no rio de janeiro

this is the number of mentions on twitter by bolsonaros cabinet to the shooting aimed at a family car in rio de janeiro
yes the graphic is empty because no one manifested themselves not even to say they felt sorry for what happened
the car was shot 80 times by military men
military investigation
shortly after news about the episode began circulating in the media the army put out a statement saying its men were responding to unfair aggression by assailants
later in the evening of april 7 it released a different note this time saying that it would conduct an investigation
although the civil police inspected the scene they will not investigate the case
the army itself will do it instead and a military court will eventually try the soldiers
thats thanks to a 2017 law that says armed forces themselves are responsible for investigating homicides committed by their personnel while on duty
human rights watch who has criticized the law at the time of its approval by president michel temer put out a statement on april 9 calling for an impartial investigation of the murder of evaldo and for the law to be repealed
on april 8 the military arrested 10 of the 12 officers who had been deployed to the scene and charged them with homicide and attempted homicide according to local newspaper extra
a judge released one of the 10 officers on april 10 following a hearing
not the first time
brazils police are known for shooting first asking later a saying that has been proven right time and again
an international amnestys report released this year says brazilian police is the most deadly in the world
only in 2018 156 percent of all homicides in the country were committed by law enforcement agents
just in rio de janeiro state and just in january 2019 police have killed 160 people
a bill dubbed anticrime package which the bolsonaros government is proposing in congress could potentially increase those alreadystaggering figures
the bill seeks to change several directives that will either scrape or significantly reduce penalties of police and military officers when they kill someone while on duty
the circumstances of the murder of evaldo a 51yearold black man is not an exception but the rule in brazil as samira bueno and renato sérgio de lima directors of the brazilian forum of public security have said in an article for folha de são paulo
evaldo teve sua vida ceifada por aqueles que juraram defendêla
seu filho jamais se livrará do trauma de ter assistido ao pai ser fuzilado por agentes estatais
mas que fique claro que a culpa não é apenas daqueles que apertaram o gatilho
ou começamos a responsabilizar toda a cadeia de comando pelos atos cometidos ou vamos continuar contando os nossos mortos e desacreditando as nossas instituições
evaldo has had his life taken from him by those who had sworn to defend it
his son will never be over the trauma of watching his father being shot at by state agents
but let us be clear that the fault lies not only with those who have pulled the trigger
either we start holding the entire chain of command accountable to their acts or we will continue to count our dead while discrediting our institutions

though the ordeal lasted only a few hours it brought great consternation among rights advocates in the region who have grown wary of tanzanias treatment of activists and journalists
in november last year angela quintal and muthoki mumo both staff of committee to protect journalists were detained for several hours in dar es salaam tanzania and had their passports temporarily seized
is tanzania on a deliberate crusade to silence human rights defenders by harassing them in order to dissuade them from coming into the country late last year it was pressfreedoms angelaquintal and muthokimumo not dr wakabi this cannot silence us freedrwakabi
felicia anthonio felanthonio april 25 2019
human rights watch asserted that tanzania under the leadership president john magufuli has witnessed a marked decline in respect for free expression association and assembly
in 2015 the united republic of tanzania promulgated the cybercrimes act
within a year of the passing of that law at least 14 tanzanians were arrested and prosecuted under the law for insulting the president on social media
march 2018 saw the passing of the electronic and postal communications online content regulations making it mandatory for bloggers to register and pay roughly us 900 per year to publish online
this caused many independent blogs to go dark
the stifling of independent media through a mixture of sanctions against media outlets and legal threats against journalists has created an atmosphere of intimidation selfcensorship and fear of expressing alternative views about the countrys leaders
the detention and subsequent deportation of wakabi back to uganda appears to be a continuation of the tanzanias government assault on free speech and dissent
alpha condé at the world economic forum in 2012 cc bysa 2

although guineas constitution allows only two consecutive terms in office the countrys current president alpha condé recently announced that he intended to seek a third term
to help achieve this he has not hesitated to make calls to violence
in an analysis published on horizon guinée sonny camara a journalist based in conakry the countrys capital reported parts of a speech the president made on march 24 2019
je laisse mon manteau de président de côté
je prends mon manteau de militant car maintenant je suis prêt à la bataille contre ces gens  soyez prêts à laffrontement   personne en guinée ne mempêchera daller devant le peuple pour lui demander ce quil veut    si cest pour vous marcher sur les pieds soyez prêts à marcher sur leurs pieds pour quils sachent que vous navez peur de rien 
i will be taking off my presidents hat
i am putting on my activists hat because now i am ready to fight against these people in the opposition  be ready for confrontation  nobody in guinea will stop me from going before my people to ask them what they want for the country  if the opposition wants to walk all over you be ready to walk all over them so that they know that you are afraid of nothing
condé was elected as president of guinea in 2010 as the first freely elected president in the countrys history
however the 2010 elections were not without controversies as observers including the carter center reported that nearly 1 million voters ballot were lost from the final count
condé was reelected in 2015 with almost 58 percent of the vote
in 2016  france 24 news channel reported that the mining company rio tinto paid guinean government official 10
5 million for mining rights in the simandou region

a few months after his reelection in may 2015 condé began to suggest his intention to seek a third term
ibrahima diallo director of liberté fm a radio station in conakry highlighted this 2016 report on nouvelles de guinée
mais à entendre alpha condé dire à lopinion publique nationale et internationale que le souverain peuple de guinée décidera ou non dun troisième mandat pour lui sous  entend que celui qui voulait être la synthèse de feu mandela et dobama pour son pays est pire que ses prédécesseurs quil a toujours combattus durant sa vie déternel opposant
aujourdhui quand koro dit cest le peuple qui décidera il veut juste faire porter par le vaillant peuple de guinée le mérite pour lui de briguer un éventuel mandat après les deux consécutifs
but to hear alpha condé say to national and international audiences that the sovereign people of guinea will decide whether or not he will have a third term implies that he who wanted to be the synthesis of the late mandela and obama for his country is worse than his predecessors whom he has fought all his life as an eternal opponent
today when koro eds note nickname for alpha condé says its the people who will decide he just wants to make the valiant people of guinea legitimize his seeking a possible term after the two consecutive ones
condé stuck to his plan by taking measures to ensure he avoided any bad surprises including dismissing the president of the constitutional court kéléfa sall a move which did not follow legal procedure
amadou tham camara a reporter with guinée news wrote
après le travail de sape qui avait été fait à la ceni cest ainsi la deuxième institution constitutionnelle en charge des élections nationales qui vient dêtre irrémédiablement fragilisée
dorénavant pour le parti au pouvoir il existe un boulevard pour avoir la majorité qualifiée des deux tiers des députés lors des élections législatives prévues au premier trimestre de 2019
cette majorité étant la condition sine qua non pour entamer la révision de la constitution
cest un pas de géant qui vient donc dêtre franchi pour faire sauter le verrou constitutionnel qui bloque le nombre de mandat du président de la république à deux
after the undermining of the ceni the national independent electoral commission it is now the second constitutional institution in charge of national elections which has been irreparably weakened
from now on for the party in power there is an avenue to having the qualified majority of two thirds of deputies during the legislative elections scheduled for the first quarter of 2019
this majority being the necessary condition for initiating the revision of the constitution
it is thus a giant step which has been taken to break through the constitutional lock which limits the number of terms as president of the republic at two
it seems that salls mistake was to warn condé  during his second term swearingin ceremony no less  against modifying the constitution
sall said then
la conduite de la nation doit nous réunir autour de lessentiel
ne nous entourons pas dextrémistes qui sont nuisibles à lunité nationale
évitez toujours les dérapages vers les chemins interdits en démocratie et en bonne gouvernance
gardezvous de succomber à la mélodie des sirènes révisionnistes car si le peuple de guinée vous a donné et renouvelé sa confiance il demeure cependant légitimement vigilant
the management of the nation must gather us around what is essential
we do not surround ourselves with extremists who are harmful to national unity
always avoid slips toward paths forbidden under democracy and good governance
refrain from succumbing to the song of revisionist sirens because although the people of guinea gave you and renewed their confidence they nevertheless remain legitimately vigilant
the reaction of guineans has been lively
at a press conference on march 29 organized by former members of the national transition council a type of interim parliament and hosted by the collective ne touche pas à ma constitution dont touch my constitution boubacar siddighy diallo one of the speakers recalled that guineas constitution comprises two parts which form an indivisible whole
he made the point that together these parts shield the constitution from any possible tampering which could have consequences that compromise the peace and stability of our country
opponents reacted strongly
at an opposition meeting cellou dalein diallo president of the union des forces démocratiques de guinée the union of democratic forces of guinea a liberal political party said
lopposition républicaine a réaffirmé sa disponibilité à former une coalition avec toutes les forces vives de la nation pour sopposer au recul démocratique et à la présidence à vie qualpha condé veut soctroyer 
the republican opposition has reaffirmed its readiness to form a coalition with all the active movements of the nation to oppose democratic retreat and the presidency for life that alpha condé wants to grant himself
sekou koundouno leader of the forces sociales de guinée fsg the social forces of guinea announced on facebook that his civil society group wrote to the prosecutor of the international criminal court asking her to keep a close eye on our country and take a public stand to avoid chaos in guinea
similarly guinean citizens reacted on twitter
les propos du président de la république sont extrêmement graves pour la paix et la quiétude sociale en guinée

nous devons impérativement interpeler la cedeao lunion africaine lonu etc

le peuple sexprime partout en guinée contre le troisième mandat
tel a été le cas à coyah tout à lheure
quatre jeunes auraient été interpellés sur instructions dun des promoteurs du troisième mandat
aucune intimidation ne freinera les guinéens dans leur quête de démocratie
mohamed tall tallmohamed2 march 31 2019
everywhere in guinea the people are speaking out against the third term
such was the case in coyah a prefecture in guineas kindia region earlier
four young people were reportedly arrested on the instructions of one of the promoters of the third term
no intimidation will stop guineans in their quest for democracy
popular facebook personality alimou sow chose irony as a way of commenting on the situation alluding to the strong winds which hit conakry on the night of april 2
il paraît que dans la mythologie grecque eole était le dieu des vents doù ladjectif éolien
alors à eole la guinée cette nuit pour emporter non pas seulement des affiches démagogiques mais également ceux qui les posent et promeuvent le 3ème nambara problèmes
autant en emporte le vent
bon ennui
it seems that in greek mythology aeolus was the god of the winds whence the adjective aeolian
so to guinea aeolus went that night to blow away not only the demagogic posters but also those who put them up and promote the third term nambara problems
gone with the wind
good night ennui
the most significant reaction however came from the guinean writer and economist ibrahima sanoh
on january 2 he launched his movement patriotes pour lalternance et le salut patriots for alternation and salvation to oppose any attempt by condé to seek a third term in 2020

in mozambique women still face challenges in accessing leadership and management positions
but there have been improvements in the current parliament for example both the president of the assembly and the heads of the two largest political caucus are women
but gender inequality still prevails in the southern african country
the undps 2016 africa human development report whose title is accelerating gender equality and womens empowerment in africa revealed that mozambican women and girls continue to suffer from inequalities such as poor access to justice poor access to school and health care and repeated acts of violence
in 2018 there were 25356 cases of domestic violence in mozambique of which 12500 were against women and 9000 against children
mozambique ranks 10th in the world for child marriages according to a unicef report from 2015
the organization defines child marriage as a marital union in which at least one person is under the age of 18
in mid2018 pilot admira antónio became the first woman to ever captain a flight in mozambique while in december 2018 an allfemale flight crew took to the skies for the first time

pope francis will visit mozambique in september 2019 just weeks before elections that will choose the new president members of the republican assembly and provincial governors
the pope was invited by mozambiques president filipe nyusi in september 2018
the visit was announced as confirmed on 26 march in a solemn ceremony which involved bodies of the catholic church in the country
president nyusi said that the popes visit would help to strengthen peace talks with the opposition party renamo which stopped military hostilities with the government in 2017 as part of a process which is still fraught with tensions
he added that it would also be an occasion to reflect on the conflict with paramilitary groups acting in the north of the country specifically in the province of cabo delgado
john paul ii was the last pope to visit mozambique in september 1988
the confirmation of the popes visit had already been anticipated since midfebruary
mozambique will hold elections this october and its still recovering from the devastation of cyclone idai which left over 500 dead and more than a million homeless
the pope has shown solidarity with the victims
expresso a minha dor e a minha solidariedade às queridas populações de moçambique zimbábue e malauí atingidas pelo ciclone idai
confio as inúmeras vítimas e suas famílias à misericórdia de deus
prayforafrica cycloneidai
papa francisco pontifex_pt 20 mars 2019
i express my pain and my solidarity with the beloved peoples of mozambique zimbabwe and malawi hit by cyclone idai
i entrust the countless victims and their families to the mercy of god
the disaster caused by the cyclone already considered one of the worst to have ever hit the southern hemisphere struck the city of beira in central mozambique on 14 march and then hit the neighbouring countries of zimbabwe and malawi
more than 300 people died in these two countries
since then the country has remained in a state of emergency which has led the government to review the electoral calendar and postpone the registration period
in the middle of a disaster govnt still trying to figure out how to rescue  accommodate thousands of people after cycloneidai president nyusi gives live tv statement to the nation to announce that the pope is set to visit mozambique in september
bad timing is understatement
zenaida machado zenaidamz
the fact that the elections will be held soon after the papal visit has raised questions from some citizens who are concerned that it could have an impact on campaigning
eh claro que a vinda do papa francisco em setembro joga a favor da frelimo e filipe nyusi
directa ou indirectamente a visita será politicamente aproveitada
seria bom que fosse adiada para novembro isto eh depois da confusão das eleições gerais agendadas para 15 de outubro
alexandre allexandremz 27 mars 2019
it is clear that pope francis visit in september plays in favour of frelimo and filipe nyusi
directly or indirectly the visit will be politically profited from
it would be good if it was postponed to november that is after the confusion of the general elections scheduled for 15 october
screenshot of la pullas episode pablo escobar is a hero available on youtube
the phenomenon didnt start with the netflix series but narcos certainly helped revive 1980s colombian drug lord pablo escobars status in north american popular culture
since it premiered in 2015 the controversial series has fueled conversations about colombias persistent international image as a cocaine paradise dominated by charismatic drug traffickers
as a response the colombian journalists behind youtube channel la pulla in spanish the taunt a project by colombian newspaper el espectador made a video responding to people who still glorify escobar as a hero
among other things the video highlights tragic episodes  and statistics  of one of the darkest periods of colombias history such as the assassination of el espectadors former director guillermo cano on december 17 1986 and the bomb attack next to their offices in september 1989
it is common in other countries to see people with tshirts of him encouraged by series such as netflixs narcos
and then when they come to colombia they pay a lot of money to go on a tour so they can admire his great accomplishments
this hero prompted thousands of people to run towards drug trafficking money like pigeons chasing corn and rendered the national economy into a little pot to launder the money that came from drug trafficking
this hero was not a friend of the people he committed 623 attacks left 1710 civilians in pain and killed 402
this hero forced us to escape from an abandoned briefcase in the street or from a stationed car with no one inside thinking there it was one more bomb
this hero forced us to stay indoors to suspect from everyone and to react with fire and violence
this hero forced us to live in constant fear
the tours referenced in the video are known as narco tours and they guide tourists around the city of medellin through famous spots related to pablo escobars life
in 2018 global voices partner radio ambulante described the tour in one of the episodes of their awardwinning podcast

for her state legislature inauguration on january 31 newlyelected brazilian deputy ana paula da silva wore a bright red dress and jewelry
she posted a photo of the occasion on her facebook and on the next day she woke up with a flurry of hateful comments
the reason her cleavage
ana paula da silva is one of the five women out of 40 legislators elected to the legislative assembly of santa catarina a southern brazilian state
her photo received 6400 comments and 6447 shares including many offenses and threats
but that is not the first time in brazil that a womans outfit choice has eclipsed her skills on her workplace
male guide to female attire
in 2009 porto alegre city councilor fernanda melchionna took to the houses tribune wearing a blackandwhite striped tie to protest a bill that would impose a dress code on female legislators
melchionna who is now a state deputy usually goes to work wearing jeans and trainers which a male colleague thought was inappropriate
she said that the debate around womens wardrobes was fit for the lazy for those who do not use their mandates to work on social problems
it is not only in politics that women go through such experiences
in 2017 lawyer pamela helena de oliveira amaral vowed to sue a judge after he interrupted a trial to scold her choice of clothing
pamela was wearing a long blue dress that revealed her shoulders
judge eugênio cesário left the room and only came back after pamela had borrowed a blazer from a female colleague
pamela said in an interview at that time
eu fiquei estarrecida sem entender
não assimilei até agora
foi humilhante vergonhoso e constrangedor o que ele me fez passar na frente dos meus colegas
a sala estava cheia de estudantes e advogados
i was astonished confused
i still havent quite comprehended it all
it was humiliating embarassing and disturbing what he made me go through in front of my colleagues
the room was full of students and other lawyers
on a post titled girl power and power dressing femininity in politics blogger nawsheen rumjaun analyzes how people tend to perceive womens choice of dress in political environments 
the number of powerful women is increasing but being a woman in politics is still tough
the clothes they choose constitute a weapon to establish their authority in this mans world
in politics there is no preset dresscode but an unspoken rule that men should wear a suit and women should have a decent outfit
those who cross the fine line between what is judged decent and what is not are at risk of being blamed because of their attire
the length of the neckline
ana paula received 51739 votes making her the fifth most voted legislator in her state
in an interview for universa a local website that covers womens issues she commented on the attacks the participation of women in society is so tiny that a neckline can become a huge issue she said
she also posted a video on her facebook page responding to the offenses
the comments on that video however were also packed with insults
a user named vitor said
com todo respeito mas você se esqueceu em qual ambiente trabalhará nos próximos dias formalidade por favor
tenha respeito decoro parlamentar
with all due respect but have you forgotten in what environment you will work in the next few days formality please
be respectful parliamentary decorum
another user a woman named yelena sier received 252 replies to her comment in which she criticized the politician
geral não entende ninguém vai no hospital com biquíni as crianças não vão a escola de pijama os homens não vão comprar pão só de cueca ninguém vai fazer uma cirurgia com qualquer roupa ninguém vai para uma festa de 15 anos ou um casamento de pijama etc cada ocasião uma traje adequado nas empresas existem uniformes e assim por diante e todo mundo sabe disso
a questão não é a roupa que a mulher usa ou deixa de usar mas para cada local um traje adequado
people do not understand no one goes to a hospital wearing a bikini children do not go to school in pajamas men do not go to buy bread in their underwear no one has surgery wearing whatever clothes no one goes to sweet fifiteen parties or a wedding in their pajamas etc
every occasion requires an appropriate attire in companies there are uniforms and so on and everyone knows that
the issue here is not about what a woman wears or doesnt wear but that each place has an appropriate attire
on a different post rosimere furtado defended ana paulas right to dresses as she chooses
parabéns pela discussão levantada enquanto uma deputada com vestes comportadissima levanta discussões perseguindo educadores e afirmando que a educação não necessita de investimento financeiro a senhora levanta discussão sobre a importância da mulher na política sobre feminicidio sobre causas que independe da cor ou traje
em um mundo onde a mente é deturpada e a sexualidade é esarcebada qualquer decote é uma guerra
congratulations for raising this issue while a state representative in a highlyrespectful dress persecutes educators and states that education does not need financial investment you have started a discussion about the importance of women in politics about femicide about causes that are independent of color or attire
in a world where the mind is misrepresented and sexuality is exarcebated any cleavage is a subject of war
ana paula fired back at her attackers by reminding them of her curriculum before she was elected to the state assembly she had been twice elected mayor of the city of bombinhas and left office with a 90 percent approval rate
ana paula also posted on facebook an interview in which she said women are in politics and society has to get used to them as they are
there are much more important issues for the legislative assembly to discuss
she also documented the attacks and said that she would sue the people who have harassed her
she told another interviewer
vou continuar vestindo o que eu quero
não pretendo me violentar para agradar ninguém
i will continue to wear whatever i want
i do not intend to abuse myself in order to please others
human rights activist ahmed mansoor is currently serving a tenyear jail sentence in the uae
photo credit martin ennals foundation via citizen lab
emirati human rights defender ahmed mansoor has endured an openended hunger strike since approximately midmarch 2019
his supporters say his health is rapidly deteriorating
security officials arrested mansoor from his home on march 20 2017 over comments he posted online
in may 2018 he was convicted under the 2012 cybercrime law of insulting the status and prestige of the uae and publishing false reports and information on social media to damage the uaes relationship with its neighbouring countries
a court sentenced him to ten years in jail and fined him 1000000 emirati dirhams us 270000
mansoor has been advocating for democratic reform and protection of human rights in his country and the region for more than a decade
he is the 2015 laureate of the martin ennals foundation which supports human rights defenders who are at risk
he is a member of the human rights watch middle east and north africa advisory committee
this is not mansoors first time behind bars
in 2011 he and four other political activists were jailed in relation to their connections to uaehewar
net an online discussion forum run by mansoor
he also used the forum to publish a petition calling for democratic reforms in the uae
state officials used this as a basis for charging mansoor with insulting uae leaders
he was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison but was released on presidential pardon after serving only seven months
prior to his 2017 arrest he campaigned online on behalf of jailed activists in the uae and elsewhere in the region
the day before his arrest he tweeted his concern about the continuous and arbitrary detention of emirati activist osama alnajjar who remained in prison despite having completed his threeyear jail sentence
according to human rights watch he also signed a joint letter with other activists in the region calling on leaders at the arab league summit in jordan in march 2017 to release political prisoners in their countries
in december 2018 the state security chamber of the federal supreme court whose verdicts are final confirmed his tenyear sentence
according to the gulf center for human rights gchr mansoor began the strike to protest poor prison conditions and his unfair trial
mansoor is believed to be currently held in alsadr prison in abu dhabi where he is kept in isolation
a source told gchr that he is being held in terrible conditions in a cell with no bed no water and no access to a shower
his health has deteriorated greatly and he is in bad shape
human rights groups expressed concerns about the activists health calling on the uae authorities to set him free
ahmed mansoor is risking his health to call attention to his deeply unjust imprisonment simply because he advocated for the kind of tolerant progressive society the uae claims to be said sarah leah whitson middle east director at human rights watch
uae authorities should immediately and unconditionally release mansoor so that he can continue to serve as a voice for justice in a region desperately in need of it she added
the international campaign for freedom in the uae called on the authorities to treat mansoor in accordance with international human rights standards and to allow international rights groups to visit him in prison
we reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of ahmed mansoor
pending this we urge the emirati authorities to treat him in line with the uns standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners which guarantees the provision of medical care and sanitary prison conditions
to ensure this it is imperative that international ngos be allowed access to alsadr prison to visit mansoor

the womans jirga councils are taking place in provinces across afghanistan
photos used with permission from afghan women for peace
in the coming months afghanistan will host its firstever nationallevel allwomen council where thousands are coming together to remind the government and the taliban that a longawaited peace is impossible without their voice
over the past decades of war women in afghanistan have experienced shocking oppression that has deepened their social isolation and made them politically cautious
antiwomen policies at state level peaked under the taliban who took power in the mid1990s before they were ousted by a u
s
led invasion
the womans jirga councils are taking place in provinces across afghanistan
photos used with permission from afghan women for peace
that invasion led to gains in universal education but women remain plagued by insecurity and the threat of violence
quotas for female representation in the legislature have not fundamentally changed the maledominated nature of afghan political culture
now a resurgent talibans appearance at negotiating tables in moscow and doha has put even these qualified achievements under threat
the group remains steadfast in its nonrecognition both of womens role in the public space and the afghan government with whom it has not yet held direct talks
presently the taliban prefers to speak to washington moscow and select groups of afghan politicians
the group has said its position on womens rights is in line with that of afghanistans main religion islam and remains hostile to gender equality activism

being heard
in the meantime afghan women and womens rights activists from all walks of life came together and established afghan women for peace a 15000 plus movement with members come from all 34 provinces

the movement began six months ago as a shared initiative of the afghan womens network ministry of women affairs high peace council and the office of the first lady of afghanistan

15000 women across the country came together in 34 gatherings one in each province to raise their voices  discuss what peace means in their own community what are their expectations  what are the costs of peace

the organizers have spoken about the role of women in the government and in society and shared ways to have a positive impact on society and make their voices heard by local and national authorities
the first aim is to create a national consensus that afghan women shouldnt be forgotten
women need to take part in the peace talks and share their demands and expectations for the future of the county

conferences have already been held in a number of provinces including panjshir khost parwan baghlan ghazni and logar
conferences will continue in 28 other provinces over coming weeks

what follows are the highlights  of the conference khost province
peace should begin from the frontier provinces 
khost province is the economic and political corridor of afghanistan
people at the district level should be included in the peace process
engaging people who are in touch with the families of insurgents is crucial
if social justice is in place and laws implemented peace will come
god and the prophet  pbuh and the people all want peace 
women and girls should be allowed to go to school 
female literacy should be increased so that children are brought up properly

todays women are aware and religious scholars should not undermine the importance of womens roles 
sharia dictates about women need to be interpreted properly 
peace begins in the family then in the community and then reaches the government
peace means accepting one another and supporting each others positive actions 
at the conclusion of every conference participants approve such a resolution about the priorities and problems facing local women

while no date has yet been set for the nationallevel jirga tribal council the event promises to bring together the work of all the provincial level groups

work at the provincial level is important
whilst there are women representatives in the parliament in kabul women governors are very rare as is female representation in other important
for many women in the frontier provinces these jirgas have been a firstever opportunity to participate in the political process and have their voices heard
women in ghazni stated
peace does not mean just an end to the war and no country can be successful in its national programs without the participation of women therefore women must have a role in the social and political peace process

an interview given by the president of angola joão lourenço to rtp portugals public television channel in which he stated that there was no hunger in his country caused some outrage among citizens
during the 30minute interview broadcast on 4 march the portuguese journalist of rtp áfrica referred to a unicef report which stated people were dying of hunger in angola
lourenço then rejected the existence of starvation in the country while admitting that there was malnutrition
he said
a nossa luta é lutar para reduzir os índices de pobreza devido aos longos anos de conflito armado
hoje há oferta de bens alimentares em angola não se pode dizer que existe hoje fome em angola é uma questão de alguma má nutrição
our struggle is to reduce the rates of poverty owing to the long years of armed conflict
today there is a supply of food in angola one cannot say that today there is serious hunger in angola it is a question of some malnutrition
president joão lourenço said this just before the visit to angola of portuguese president marcelo rebelo de sousa and a few days before a catholic priest and human rights activist criticized the death of angolans from hunger in a region suffering from drought
the activist manuel mapanda better known as dago nível questioned the presidents comments
como é que o senhor vai dizer que não existe fome em angola não leu a denúncia do padre jacinto wacussanga sobre a morte de um angolano por fome será que nos gambos e no curoca já não há fome assim que jlo assumiu a presidência a maioria dos angolanos passou a ter a cesta básica e a fome foi eliminada
how is the gentleman going to say that hunger does not exist in angola did he not read the criticism of father jacinto wacussanga about the death of an angolan from hunger does it mean that in gambos and curoca there is now no hunger as soon as jlo joão lourenço assumed the presidency the majority of angolans got basic essential goods and hunger was eliminated
during the unfortunate interview the angolan head of state also made clear his intention to combat corruption which is part of the partys electoral programme
ninguém pode garantir que daqui para a frente não haverá corrupção e que não haverá corruptos mas que não ficarão impunes tal como sempre foi
não haverá mais intocáveis segundo joão lourenço
esse tempo ficou para trás
nobody can guarantee that from this moment onwards there will be no corruption and that there will be no corrupt people but that they will not remain unpunished
there will be no more untouchables according to joão lourenço
that time is behind us
in 2018 the regional forum for university development fordu a civic association in the field of education headquartered in southern angola produced a documentary with no online version entitled angola a country at risk
it highlights the high number of people searching for food in bins both in the urban centre of huambo province the documentary focus and in the countrys capital luanda

notícias a facebook page dedicated to sharing news there was a clear criticism of the presidents remarks
precisamos reconhecer que ainda há muita gente em angola vivendo á sic margem da sociedade problema que dificilmente se resolverá se não haver uma promoção de programas de inclusão social credíveis onde é cobrado e prestado contas
e não com este nascer de uma nova elite de gatunos tipo quem não se safou no outro tempo que aproveite á sic brecha agora em que o artista principal e financeiro da nação é o j

a screenshot of ict minister idah nantaba who survived the assassination attempt via youtube video
on march 24 2019 news broke that ugandan information and communications technology minister of state hon
idah nantaba had survived an assassination attempt
ugandan police shot and killed one of her assailants in the small town of nagojje 53 kilometers east of the capital kampala
over the last five years numerous cases of assassinations of highprofile political religious or military people have led to few concrete convictions or clear reports
ugandan citizens were therefore relieved to hear that the police had taken swift action
however a more complicated story has emerged regarding mistaken identity
heres what happened
nantaba called the police to inform them that two men on a motorbike had been trailing her for more than 40 kilometers
police swung into action and intercepted two men on a motorbike near the nagojje trading center
ronald ssebulime 40 a single father of four was a driving a regular motorcycle and carried a passenger behind him
police mistook the two men as nantabas assailants
a chase ensued and ssebulime hit a hump
he and his passenger fell off the bike and the two fled on foot
police fired shots in the air and ssebulime eventually surrendered
the passenger fled
ssebulime pleaded innocent but police handcuffed and threw him into a police vehicle
they drove for a short distance and then said the order had changed before they shot and killed him according to several eyewitnesses who spoke with ntv uganda
one eyewitness said
ssebulime was picked up from the patrol van already in handcuffs and shot
another said
the policeman took two steps back and shot him twice
botched investigation
in the confusion that followed police tweeted that the shooting was justified because the men riding on the motorbike refused to surrender
several shots were fired in their direction to cause them to surrender but all in vain
in the process sebbulime ronald a resident of nakabugo village nakabugo parish pakiso sub county and busiro county in wakiso district was shot dead during the pursuit
uganda police force policeug march 24 2019
they added that a second suspect disappeared and fear he is armed and dangerous although police could not confirm this
police is still searching the area with canine dogs for the second suspect who is feared armed and dangerous
we want to inform the public that the minister despite the scare is very safe and was not attacked at any stage as alleged in the media
uganda police force policeug march 24 2019
police spokesman fred enanga said that the minister witnesses and police officers involved in the pursuit would give statements while they continue to investigate ssebulimes phone records as well as registration papers belonging to his motorbike
irene nakazibwe sister of the deceased insists her brother was at the wrong place at the wrong time
according to nakazibwe ssebulime was in fact heading to st
andrews secondary school to visit two of his children studying senior one and senior three classes in an interview with ntv
they had spoken earlier in the day about the visit
ssebulime lost his wife back in 2012 and has been taking care of his four children as a single father
it is unclear why he tried to run from the police when he had a national id card and a driving permit
nakazibwe tells her story on ntv uganda
on march 27 2019 the police finally admitted that ssebulime was mistakenly identified and wrongfully murdered by officers and sent sympathies to the family of the deceased
they also confirmed that ssebulime was unarmed and only carried a bag full of soda and food intended for his children

bodaboda paranoia
the death of ssebulime has stirred mixed emotions among those who use bodaboda or motorcycle taxi as a popular form of affordable transport
at least five high profile murders involving military chiefs members of parliament religious leaders have occurred in the last three years  all performed by hitmen riding on motorbikes
this has put both bodaboda drivers and highlevel officials on high alert
twitter user ganda gannyana thinks the reason ssebulime was killed without substantial proof of intentions to assassinate the minister stems from directives following the murder of member of parliament hon
ibrahim abiriga
president yoweri museveni said that if a leader suspects someone is trailing them with bad intentions they should sort that person out
it was a stupid directive from kagutamuseveni that if you only suspect anyone trailing you sort them out first and quick and the rest we sort later
now see an innocent ssebulimeronald has been slain
shot in handcuffs thats cold blood
gandagannyana iamsegawa march 26 2019
twitter user kyeyune moses contemplates the confusion surrounding the circumstances of ssebulimes death
the story of ronald ssebulime is bigger than meets the eyes
different accounts of who shot the suspected assassin and how the he was killed
but most touching is the tell of his kids now at school
they lost their mother their dad is now gone

twitter user angelo peter is furious that the police failed to produce any evidence that ssebulime was dangerous before they shot and killed him
when policeug wanted to pin bobiwine for treason they produced guns they found in his hotel room in less than 24hrs
but they cant produce and show us the gun ronald ssebulime had before they shot him dead after arrest
angelopeter nzeangelo march 26 2019
in a press briefing nantaba narrates her story and questions who might have given the order to murder ssebulime
she suggests the whole scenario could have been orchestrated as a coverup by masterminds of high profile assassinations   and still believes ssebulime may have been involved in her assassination attempt
the masterminds of these assassinations that have been happening in this country and according to what we see will still continue because ssebulime was the one who was supposed to be a witness but the primary witness has been killed
edward lowassa was a longtime ruling party ccm member until he was banned from running for president and joined opposition party chadema
recently he bounced back to ccm

october 18 2015
in tanzania highprofile opposition party members have defected to the ruling party chama cha mapinduzi or the party of the revolution casting a shadow on multiparty politics in the east african nation

most defectors come from the leading opposition party chama cha demokrasia na maendeleo or chadema the democracy and development party
four chadema members of parliament 75 councilors and several village chairmen have joined ccm in the last few years

the tanzania constitution forum has called for a constitutional amendment to bar defections
the aim is to avoid unnecessary costs the government incurs in organizing frequent byelections said tcf chairman hebron mwakagenda according to the east african

the national electoral commission has conducted several byelections at a high cost that yielded below 50 percent voter turnouts
campaigns have created fear and lack of trust among citizens
the case of edward lowassa
on march 1 2019 retired prime minister edward lowassa member of the central committee of chadema bounced back to ccm his longtime party after defecting from it four years ago

at a brief public ceremony ccm chairman and tanzanian president john pombe magufuli warmly welcomed  lowassa 
mr
lowassa has shown himself to be a true gentleman
we are taught to forgive and our aim is to build a new united tanzania with no political conflicts
lowassa confirmed that he is back home and there is no reason now for him to be in opposition
lowassa is one of few groomed by one of the earliest parties the tanganyika african national union party or tanu formed before tanzanias independence from britain in 1961 and later ccms youth wing during the days of a singleparty system

under the auspices of ccm lowassa served as mp for the monduli district for 25 years and held ministerial responsibilities in parliament over four decades
in 2008 while serving as prime minister under thenpresident jakaya kikwete lowassa was forced to resign after being implicated in a fraud scandal

lowassa moved to chadema on august 4 2015 just before the general election after the ccm banned him from running as a presidential candidate
he condemned ccm and its leaders as dictators undemocratic and greedy power mongers

chadema then nominated lowassa as a presidential candidate under ukawa a coalition of opposition parties
in the 2015 general election lowassa obtained 6 million votes around 40 percent against ccms magufuli who got 8
8 million votes or nearly 60 percent

with lowassas political influence opposition parties chadema earned 70 seats in parliament compared to 48 in 2010 while the civic united front cuf also a member of ukawa earned 45 seats compared to 36

welcomed or lured back 
lowassas return to the ruling party sparked both praise and ridicule from politicians and prominent political analysts
ccm spokesman humphrey polepole congratulated lowassa for his bold move to return to his longtime party
to come back to apologize is a great wisdom and humility
others have argued that high defection rates are not good for national politics
magdalena sakaya cuf deputy secretary general for mainland tanzania said the move is bad for democracy and signals a conspiracy to kill the opposition she added

dr
adolf mihanjo head of the faculty of philosophy and religious studies at the university of dar es salaam termed defectors as people who lack ideology and only seek leadership positions
people have started feeling that defectors are being bribed  this is dangerous
likewise cuf deputy secretary general for the islands of zanzibar nassoro mazrui expressed pessimism with tanzanias political future saying corruption has engulfed multiparty politics
chadema chairperson freeman mbowe believes that defectors are being lured by ccm as a way of muzzling the opposition
however maulid mtulia and godwin mollel two defectors who joined ccm last year said they made the switch out of satisfaction with magufulis performance
opposition party leader zitto kabwe of the actwazalendo party and mp for kigoma urban rejected their claims calling them empty reasons without grounds and backings
dr
richard mbunda a political science professor at the university of dar es salaam cautioned that it is hard to regain legitimacy once its gone
defections create selfdisenfranchisement which can be disastrous the government could slip as a democracy which could then lead to civil disobedience and illegitimate governance he observed

squeezed civic space for opposition political parties
tanzania legalized multiparty democracy in 1992 under article 3 1 of the constitution
in a multiparty democracy political parties play a fundamental role in providing stability and peace needed for peaceful political transitions
however the current government has imposed a series of restrictions that limit the power of opposition parties such as limitations on political rallies and livebroadcasting parliamentary sessions

in february new amendments to the political parties act were passed that further limit opposition politics
since magufuli assumed power in 2015 theres been a continuous squeeze on civic political and social spaces through various bills and legislation to limit freedom of expression online and in the streets

mauritanian authorities arrested two bloggers abderrahmane weddady and cheikh ould jiddou for reporting on corruption
weddady and jiddou were arrested on march 22 after they appeared before mauritanias economic crimes unit to respond to a summons
both had investigated and reported on allegations of corruption involving the countrys president mohamed ould abdel aziz

prior to their arrests they both wrote on facebook about the alleged ties of ould abdel aziz to a us 2 billion bank account in dubai
according to media reports emirati authorities had frozen the account at the request of the us department of the treasury in its fight against money laundering

weddady wrote on his facebook page that police questioned him about his sources and asked why he did not wait for the state to investigate the matter
he answered that the news of the frozen assets was reported online and by foreign media and that he has no faith in a serious investigation into any crime involving the president and those around him
in early march both bloggers were summoned and questioned by the unit about their writings on the alleged assets
authorities confiscated their passports and national id cards and then released them that same day
then on march 22 police arrested the two men after the public prosecutors office concluded that the reports were untrue and pledged to investigate and prosecute those who disseminated them to harm the country its institutions its citizens and its judicial and financial systems
the two bloggers stand accused of spreading false accusations against ould abdel aziz under article 348 of mauritanias penal code
they risk between six months to five years in jail each
they remain in jail pending trial

in an interview with global voices via whatsapp nasser wedaddy the brother of abderrahmane weddady and a global voices community member said that prosecutors have failed to present actual evidence against abderrahmane and ould jiddou
he also noted that their lawyers have found no actual evidence on file for the case
he said
the prosecutor alleges that the evidence was lost
its his euphemism for we dont have any evidence to charge them and we made it all up
since 2016 abderrahmane weddady had also been reporting and writing about a real estate scam in which a man with alleged ties to the presidents family fraudulently acquired ownership of houses of thousands of mauritania to resell them his brother nasser weddady said
jiddou also wrote about the scam on his facebook page his wife told human rights watch
nasser wedaddy also commented on this work
my brothers 39month investigation into the countrys biggest ponzi scheme since its independence has been credited by many as a service to society
he managed to uncover a swindle that ended up costing over 700 families their homes and savings
he even uncovered how the current president is protecting and benefiting from the scam
freedom of expression is tightly restricted in mauritania and the authorities often use criminal defamation laws to silence human rights activists bloggers and journalists who speak out against the regime or expose government wrongdoing

in a statement to global voices the family of abderrahmane weddady demanded that both men be released and all charges against them dropped
we demand the immediate and unconditional release of both abderrahmane weddady and cheikh ould jiddou
and the formal dismissal of any legal procedures against them and a formal apology from the mauritanian government for this gross and arbitrary subversion of the legal system to persecute political opponents
osama alnajjar remains in detention despite completing his jail sentence two years ago

emirati activist osama alnajjar remains in unlawful detention despite having completed his threeyear jail sentence more than two years ago
alnajjar was arrested in march 2014 for posting tweets denouncing that his father had been tortured in prison and calling for his release and that of other prisoners of conscience in the emirates
osamas father hussain alnajjar is one of 94 emirati activists who were prosecuted en masse in 2013 for calling for political reform in the emirates on charges related to harming state security
he is currently serving 11 years in prison
in november 2014 the state security chamber of the federal supreme court whose verdicts cannot be appealed sentenced osama to three years in jail under the countrys cybercrime law on a number of charges that include instigating hatred against the state and designing and running a website with satirical and defaming ideas and information
he was due to be released on 17 march 2017 but at the request of public prosecution the court deemed him a threat to national security and extended his detention without specifying for how long
two year later osama remains behind bars with no end to his detention in sight
in a recent statement marking the anniversary of the end of his official sentence the international campaign for freedom in the uae said
as there is no trial proceeding this form of detention those transferred to such facilities can be held indefinitely with the government  rather than the judiciary  handing down punishment
this type of administrative detention grossly violates international standards of due process
although he was not convicted of a terrorist offence osama is being held at a counselling centre at alrazeen prison under the countrys counterterrorism law
emirati authorities claim that the purpose of these facilities is to offer guidance to those considered to be a threat against the state
however rights groups say that authorities are using counterterrorism and these socalled counselling centres as a pretext to indefinitely extend the detention of prisoners of conscience

six students were detained on tuesday march 12 in kirundo province in northeast burundi for scribbling on pictures of president pierre nkurunziza in five textbooks
the students were accused of insulting the head of state
the national federation of associations engaged in childrens welfare in burundi fenadeb reported that another student 13 had been immediately released because he was a minor under the age of 15
three students were reportedly provisionally released on friday march 15 but the remaining three were kept in custody
the girls aged 15 to 17 if found guilty risk up to five years in prison for insulting the president
iwacu newspaper reported that families affected were deeply distressed
scribbling on the presidents picture is a punishable offense under the burundian law according to a reuters report
however the age of the offenders may serve as a mitigating circumstance in these students trial
as a teacher anonymously noted the textbooks had not been checked for several years and are often shared by students so it is difficult to know who marked them
a similar episode occurred in 2016 following the controversy over the presidents third term where high school students scribbled on textbook pictures of nkurunziza
authorities took this as a serious insult and expelled hundreds of students from various schools across the country
eleven students were charged with insulting the head of state and threatening state security although they were reportedly later cleared
these actions were highly criticized
zeid raad al hussein united nations high commissioner for human rights issued a statement on june 29 2016
i am dismayed by continuing reports of the suspension and arrest of schoolchildren and students for having scribbled on pictures of the president in textbooks

pierre nkurunziza has been president of burundi since 2005
in 2015 he was controversially nominated by his party for a third term in office
in march last year nkurunziza was named eternal supreme guide by his political party the national council for the defense of democracyforces for the defense of democracy cnddfdd
evariste ndayishimiye cnddfdds secretary general explained why that title was conferred on nkurunziza
he is our leader
therefore in our party no one is comparable to him
he is our parent he is the one who advises us
that is why i ask all our members to respect that because a home without the man its head can be overlooked by anybody
for us we have the best
while the cnddfdd downplayed the title nkurunzizas reinforced status as the eternal supreme guide has made it difficult for anyone to disagree with his choices including his move to change the twoterm limit enshrined in the countrys constitution
this reflects a centralization of power in the ruling party around nkurunziza and supporters and of the partys control of state institutions
scribblers in solidarity
netizens have taken to scribbling on pictures of president nkurunziza in protest through two hashtags nkurunziza and burundi
burundians online are scribbling in protest doodling on pictures of president nkurunziza in reaction to the arrest of three school girls who were detained for drawing over the picture of the president on their school books

crackdown on criticism 
burundis government has become increasingly sensitive to criticism since 2015 after a failed coup clashes with rebel groups criticisms of rights abuses sanctions economic hardships and a refugee crisis
nkurunzizas third term bid was opposed by the european union and the united nations who demanded a restoration of stability before elections
faced with these challenges a siege mentality hardened and authorities clamped down more harshly on perceived threats
the human rights watch may 2018 special report discovered that burundian state security forces intelligence services and members of the ruling partys youth league the imbonerakure carried out brutal targeted attacks on opponents or suspected opponents human rights activists and journalists killing an estimated 1700 people and forcibly disappearing raping torturing beating arbitrarily detaining and intimidating countless others
this has led to a refugee crisis that has seen burundians fleeing particularly to tanzania rwanda the democratic republic of congo drc and uganda
while thousands have returned the united nations high commissioner for refugees recorded over 347000 total burundian refugees in february 2019 unhcr asserts
political unrest in burundi took a deadly turn in 2015 after the president announced plans to seek a third term
street protests led to violent clashes and hundreds of thousands fled to nearby countries in search of safety
earlier this month burundi closed the united nations human rights office after 23 years saying it was no longer needed
the government was incensed with former united nations high commissioner for human rights zeid raad al hussein who described nkurunzizas burundi as one of the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times in february 2018
media outlet closures harassment of opponents and clampdowns on ngos and restrictions in political space for alternative narratives and arguments
for example rights activist germain rukiki who documented acts of torture committed by nkurunzizas regime was sentenced to 32 years in jail in 2018 for participation in an insurrectional movement undermining state security and rebellion
rukikis trial was also marred by irregularities and came weeks before the controversial constitutional referendum
the scribbling affair is also indicative of the governments increasingly conservative moralizing approach including mandatory marriages for cohabiting nonmarried couples in 2017 clampdowns on prostitution and begging

nigeria will hold a presidential election on february 16 2019 and all eyes are on this election as a test to prove the strength of nigerias democratic norms values and unity
this year there are five main candidates in the race out of 73 total presidential candidates
two major contenders include the incumbent president muhammadu buhari all progressive congress and the opposition candidate and former vice president atiku abubakar peoples democratic party
the other three candidates obiageli ezekwesili kingsley moghalu and omoyole sowore have been termed the third force because they lack political experience but still present significant competition
amid the cacophony of electoral campaigns and the attendant passion from supporters  both online and offline  here are the key issues that may get lost in the noise
read more meet nigerias presidential candidates of 2019
old and the strongman syndrome
nigerias two major contenders buhari 76 and atiku 72 both have long histories of political engagement in nigeria leaving many to question their health and longevity as presidential hopefuls
with the end of longtime rulers like south african president jacob zuma 76 and zimbabwes robert mugabe 94 who was forced out of power after 37 years as president it has felt like an end to regimes led by the old and strong men in africa
but this hope has not lasted
paul biya 84 was reelected as president of cameroon making him the oldest political leader in subsaharan africa
the health of nigerias leaders became a major political consideration after late president umaru musa yaradua died in office on may 5 2010
yaraduas illness and continued absence created a power vacuum because he did not hand it over to his deputy goodluck jonathan before he traveled abroad for treatment
incumbent president buhari has made about ten trips to the united kingdom for medical treatment of an undisclosed ailment
he has spent more than 170 days in london on official medical leave since becoming president in 2015 according to the new york times
can younger candidates stand a better chance this year there are 10 candidates under the age of 40 and 16 candidates between the ages of 4549
but younger candidates may not fare well because nigerias long history of military rule has embedded a culture of political actors who have both the clout and wealth to fund party politics and this takes time and connections to cultivate
buhari and abubakar both have strong political bases
buhari has a loyal following in the northern part of the country while abubakar is perceived as widely accepted across different tribes and religions in the country
their ages do not appear to be a factor in garnering support and loyalty
ethnicity and religion
nigeria is whats known as an ethnic fault line state  ethnicity and religion have long played a central role in elections and general politics
the 2015 elections showed that the two major contestants received bloc votes from their various states and geopolitical zones according to an article in the journal of african elections
also ethnic sentiments were used to appeal to voters
ethnocentric hate speech surged both online and offline before and after the 2015 presidential elections
similarly in 2017 some nigerian writers raised alarm over the vile ethnic hate speech that almost consumed the nation
former president goodluck jonathan lost in the polls over his failure to handle the islamic militant group boko harams bombings that rattled the nation and caused widespread insecurity
boko harams abduction of schoolgirls in chibok led to a global outcry of bringbackourgirls when it was clear to citizens that the government was not doing enough to intervene
buhari and abubakar will both rely on ethnic alliances to win votes
buhari a northerner fulanimuslim has retained yemi osibanjo as his vicepresidential candidate in order to garner votes from the southwestern yorubachristian part of the country
abubakar a northerner fulanimuslim has picked his vicepresidential candidate from the southeastern igbochristian part of the country
because buhari and abubakar are from the same ethnoreligious group tensions may not be as high as they were in 2015 elections when jonathan goodluck a southern minority ijaw christian ran against buhari
free speech and press freedom
buharis administration has been accused of major human rights violations and many hashtags have trended on social media in 2018 calling for the release of detained netizens and journalists
on march 17 2016 nigerian journalist yomi olomofe was brutally assaulted and detained by nigerian police in an attack against free speech
nigerian journalist daniel elombah and his brother timothy elombah were arrested on new years day 2017 for a story they did not even write
in august that year nigerian trader joe fortemose chinakwe was arrested by for naming his pet dog buhari
jones abiri publisher of weekly source was arrested on july 21 2016 by state security dss agents at his office in yenagoa bayelsa state
freejonesabiri trended for several days on twitter until abiri was released on august 15 2018 after a twoyear detention
freesamuelogundipe trended when nigerian journalist samuel ogundipe was detained for three days by nigerias special tactical squad after refusing to name his sources for a story concerning the forceful prevention of lawmakers by security agents from entering the nigerian national assembly in early august 2018
deji adeyanju a political activist and member of the opposition party was rearrested in december 2018 and has been in detention since then due to a fresh petition
buhari has openly expressed his aversion to a free press and freedom of speech
in an address to lawyers last year he stated that the rule of law must be subject to the supremacy of the nations security and national interest
on the other hand abubakar has promised to run an inclusive governance structure that will harness nigerias diversity and uphold a just and fair environment where the rights of all citizens are protected by a transparent government
only time will tell how these issues will unfold throughout the election period and beyond
the great mosque of mecca considered the holiest city in islam

when saudi journalist and washington post columnist jamal khashoggi was killed last october in the saudi consulate in istanbul it cast a long shadow on the exercise of free speech for journalists from saudi arabia and across the arab region
the resulting political fallout also shook some of the most powerful institutions and voices in islam
after the circumstances of khashoggis disappearance and death came to light multiple world leaders openly accused saudi crown prince mohammad bin salman of ordering the journalists murder
in what appeared to be a response to these accusations the imam of the grand mosque in mecca delivered a friday sermon on october 19 in which he exalted bin salman the kingdoms de facto ruler
sheikh abdulrahman alsudais lauded the modernizing reforms of bin salman and denounced attacks against these blessed lands in his sermon which was preapproved by saudi authorities
he went on to conclude that it was the solemn duty of all muslims to support and obey the king and the faithful crown prince the protectors and guardians of the holy sites and islam

responding in a opinion piece for the new york times ucla school of law professor khaled m
abou el fadl said the sermon had desecrated and defiled the podium of the prophet
by using the grand mosque to whitewash acts of despotism and oppression he wrote prince mohammed has placed the very legitimacy of the saudi control and guardianship of the holy places of mecca and medina in question
saudi arabias long history of politics in religion
with its theocratic system of governance this is not uncommon in the ultraconservative kingdom
in fact saudi leaders have long used religion as a tool of political power since the kingdoms inception
saudi arabia is home to islams two holiest sites mecca and medina

every year millions of muslims from around the world travel to mecca to perform hajj or pilgrimage one of islams five pillars
this has allowed the saudi government to claim a special form of religious legitimacy in islam
the kingdom has exploited this legitimacy to gain and maintain political power
when the first saudi state was established in 1744 muhammad ibn saud emir of the small oasis town of diriya made a pact with religious leader and theologian muhammad ibn abd alwahhab
abd alwahhab started an ultraconservative religious movement today known as wahhabism based on an austere interpretation of quran and prophetic traditions

fanack an independent media and analysis site focused on the mena region explains that the union was intended to create an islamic realm ruled by a strict interpretation of islam
this first saudi state collapsed decades later and a second state was established in 1824 only to collapse again in 1891
in 1924 and 1925 the ibnsaud family invaded mecca and medina islams two holiest cities respectively with the help of wahhabi fighters
in 1932 the kingdom of saudi arabia was established
ever since saudi rulers have continued to use religion to serve their political interests
voices challenging official religious discourse silenced 
today the kingdoms history is at the top of mind for many saudis as they grapple with rising levels of repression under the leadership of mohammad bin salman
religious clerics are enlisted to treat those who denounce rights violations or call for reform as enemies of islam and state authorities continue to deploy religious discourse to serve the political interests of rulers
in january 2019 saudi minister of islamic affairs abdullatif ibn abdulaziz alsheikh condemned the arab uprisings of 2011 and 2012 describing them as poisonous and destructive to the arab and muslim human
in an implicit reference to criticism targeted at the kingdom after khashoggis murder the minister denounced what he described as unjust attacks from the enemies of islam and accused muslims who are critical of the kingdom and its policies of spreading sedition bringing discord and inciting against their rulers and leaders
reflecting on the link between wahhabism and political oppression saudi human rights activist yahya assiri who lives in exile in london tweeted on january 13
الاستبداد منظومة متكاملة
وتمكن عندنا باستخدام الدين عندما تحالف ابن عبدالوهاب مع ابن سعود فنشأت السعودية و الوهابية كتوأم خبيث لن تنجو بلادنا إلا بالخلاص من الاستبداد السعودي الوهابي وكلما قلنا ذلك قال البعض بحسن نية أن الوهابية حركة دينية بينما هي سياسية صرفة

yahya assiri يحيى عسيري المقسطون abo1fares january 13 2019
oppression is a comprehensive system and in our country it is enabled by religion
when ibn saud and ibn abd alwahhab allied saudi arabia and wahhabism grew as a malignant twin
our country will not survive unless we get rid of the saudi wahhabi oppression
as we have said this others with a good intention have said that wahhabism is a religious movement while it is purely political
but the voices of people like assiri are silenced in saudi arabia
another such voice is that of abdullah alhamid one of the founders of the nowdissolved saudi civil and political rights association acpra who is currently behind bars
alhamid is serving eleven years in prison for his human rights activities on charges that include breaking allegiance to and disobeying the ruler and inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations
he was convicted in 2013 by the infamous specialized criminal court established to try terrorrelated cases but often used to go after human rights activists
rights groups reported that alhamid began a hunger strike on 17 february
in a statement attributed to him and published by the mbs metoo human rights platform alhamid announced that hes demanding the release of imprisoned human rights activists and political prisoners
abdullah alhamid
photo from his goodreads account
in addition to his human rights activism alhamid is a poet and an academic
in his writings he has used islamic texts and traditions to call for democratic reforms advocate for human rights and to critique the religious institutions that enable repression in saudi arabia such as the council of senior scholars the kingdoms highest religious body which advises the king on religious matters
he once accused the council of serving to support those who steal the peoples money dignity and freedom and of playing a role in harming citizenship plurality tolerance and producing violence and extremism
he also has advocated for a modern religious discourse that embraces a consultative rule and he opposed what he described as the common religious discourse in the kingdom which calls for prayer behind a unjust imameven if he violated ones freedom justice and equality
crackdown on independent clerics 
while silencing those who challenge the governments official discourse saudi arabia has also taken a hard line against clerics who are not sufficiently supportive of the crown princes policies and actions
saudi clerics sheikh salman alawda ali alomari and sheikh awad alqarni were all arrested in september 2017 on various charges that include their alleged ties to the muslim brotherhood
rights groups say the charges were brought on because the clerics did not vocally support the severance of diplomatic and economic ties with qatar by saudi arabia and its allies
and all three may face the death penalty
at 62 sheikh salman alawda is a prominent cleric with a massive social media following not only in saudi arabia but across the arab region
the combined number of his followers on instagram facebook twitter and youtube is more than 22 million
he previously expressed support for the arab uprisings of 2011 and called for democratic reforms in the kingdom and the region

amnesty international and other human rights groups linked his arrest to a tweet posted on 8 september in which he reacted to news reports of a potential reconciliation between the nations
in the second part of the tweet he wrote may god harmonize between their hearts for what is good for their people
ali alomari is a religious scholar and the chairman of 4shbab a youthfocused islamic tv channel
in contrast to others he was not vocal on political issues in the kingdom
he even once tweeted in support of the kingdoms leaders and posted a tweet praying for bin salmans success when he was appointed crown prince back in june 2017
sheikh awad alqarni faces a number of accusations that include supporting the muslim brotherhood outlawed in saudi arabia and slandering the kingdom its policies and its systems
several other clerics are also currently behind bars in saudi arabia
some have called for democratic reforms in the kingdom like alawda while others voiced opposition to bin salmans policies or social reforms
others like alomari previously expressed support to saudi rulers and the crown prince

what these cases confirm is that under bin salmans de factorule silence is no longer enough
beyond a mandate to stamp out independent voices  the words of anyone who is not writing in service of the kingdoms leadership or political agenda  clerics must go the extra mile and outwardly praise the crown prince and saudi leadership
the opinions and ideologies of those prisoners of conscience currently behind bars in saudi arabia including womens rights defenders human rights defenders shia protesters and religious clerics may vary
but under the de facto rule of bin salman these individuals are all subject to injustices at the hands of saudi authorities including arbitrary detention solitary confinement torture and enforced disappearance
to legitimise and whitewash these acts of oppression saudi rulers never hesitate to use religion as a coverup
according to the cuban government 20000 doctors attended 113 million brazilians in the last five years

thousands of brazilians could be left without healthcare as cuba begins pulling out 8400 doctors who have been stationed in the countrys smallest and remotest towns for the past five years
in an official statement dated november 14 havana announced it will end its agreement with brazil as a response to presidentelect jair bolsonaros public comments about the program which it deemed threatening and depreciative
on multiple occasions over the course of the presidential campaign bolsonaro has disputed the skills of the cuban doctors and criticized the agreements terms
launched in 2013 by former president dilma rousseff the program mais médicos more doctors sought to widen healthcare access in brazils most vulnerable towns some of which never had a resident doctor before
it opened thousands of job posts in those areas offering salaries of around 3500 dollars per month plus a stipend for housing and meals for comparison brazils minimum wage is currently around 300 dollars per month
the program gave preference to brazilian doctors but after theyve signed up for only six percent of the job openings the remaining vacancies were filled by cuban doctors who were brought in through a deal signed by brazils ministry of health and havana and mediated by whos pan american health organisation
by the agreements terms brazil doesnt hire the cuban doctors directly instead it pays the cuban government who recruits manages and compensates them as civil servants  with a salary that is around 25 percent of what brazil would pay them had they been hired individually

the deal met plenty of criticism since the first doctors began to arrive
they were booed in airports by massive crowds and were called slaves in protests led by brazilian medical associations
bolsonaro himself at the time a congressman at the chamber of deputies went to the supreme court demanding the programs suspension
both during his time as congressman and the presidential race he repeatedly said that the program was slave work
hes promised to send the doctors back to cuba with the strike of a pen so that they could assist the the members of the workers party who will soon be sent to guantanamo
in a tv interview in july 2018 he said that no one has any proof of whether the cuban doctors have any knowledge of medicine
in its official pull out statement havanas said
el pueblo brasileño que hizo del programa más médicos una conquista social que confió desde el primer momento en los médicos cubanos aprecia sus virtudes y agradece el respeto sensibilidad y profesionalidad con que le atendieron podrá comprender sobre quién cae la responsabilidad de que nuestros médicos no puedan continuar prestando su aporte solidario en ese país
the brazilian people  who made the more doctors program a success who trusted the cuban doctors from the beginning who appreciated the respectful sensitive and professional treatment they received  will understand who is responsible for our doctors being unable to continue providing support in the country
bolsonaro responded on his social media channels that havana simply didnt want to accept new terms to relay the full salary back to its doctors and that theyd validate their medical diplomas in brazil through an exam
he called it an irresponsible decision by the cuban dictatorship for disregarding the impact it would have on the lives of brazilians
as journalist leonardo sakamoto writes this could lead to the first social crisis in bolsonaros government and one thats unfolding even before he takes office
cubans make up 45 percent of the more doctors professionals
around 28 percent of brazils cities served by the program only count with one resident cuban doctor
around 90 percent of the doctors working in indigenous areas in brazil are cubans
brazil problems cuban solutions
five years ago brazil had a deficit of 54000 doctors in its public health system
the country had 18 doctors for every 1000 inhabitants
for comparison that rate is currently of 25 in the united states and 75 in cuba
small towns in brazil have always struggled to attract medical professionals who complain about the lack of infrastructure
brazil also doesnt train enough doctors to serve its 200million population
the small socialist nation on the other hand has doctors to spare
currently cuba has 50000 health workers stationed in 67 countries
leasing of medical experts is cubans main export they generate 11 billion us dollars in revenue to the state per year more than tourism does

cuba has sent its first medical brigade abroad in 1963 after the independence war in algeria
since then according to a story by radio ambulante almost 500000 cuban physicians have worked in africa asia and the americas
over the years a few cubans have told the brazilian press that they felt exploited
some have joined lawsuits against both governments as well as the who
others have reported threats made by their government
however many said in a podcast by radio ambulante that even with havanas retention of 75 percent of the wages they dont think the salary is unfair
the results
a study by the federal university of minas gerais which interviewed 14 thousand patients in 700 cities one year after more doctors began revealed a high level of satisfaction with the program 85 percent said that healthcare in their regions were better or a lot better
the participants highlighted poor infrastructure and the lack of medicines as unresolved problems
another study from fundação getúlio vargas fgv shows that the program helped the government to reduce a third of its expenses with hospitalizations
débora mazetto one of the economists who led the study told bbc brazil
houve uma melhora na qualidade do atendimento à população
imagine uma comunidade que não tinha médicos com o aumento das consultas em áreas desassistidas foi possível identificar e tratar doenças com agilidade evitando internações que poderiam ser de fato evitáveis
there has been an improvement on the quality of the services offered to the population
can you imagine a community that never had a doctor with the rising numbers of appointments in areas that were complete unassisted before its now possible to identify and treat diseases faster avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations
what next
since november 14 over 200 doctors have already returned to cuba
the pan american health organization expects that all of them will have returned by december 12
in many public clinics people have found themselves without medical care this past week or were told that theyd only have a doctor available once a week from now on
although the brazilian government claims that 92 percent of the spots left vacant by the cubans have already been filled newspaper folha de s
paulo said this number might not mean much at the end of the day
em 2017 o ministério da saúde abriu concurso para selecionar brasileiros para o mais médicos
ao todo 6
285 se inscreveram para 2
320 vagas mas só 1
626 apareceram para trabalhar
cerca de 30 deixaram seus postos antes de um ano de serviço
in 2017 the health ministry opened a call to select brazilians to more doctors
in total 6285 applied to 2320 openings but only 1626 showed up to work
around 30 percent left their jobs before completing one year on them
as with many social programs in brazil more doctors did have its gray areas but it also dramatically changed public health in regions that were completely forgotten by the brazilian state
perhaps the greatest challenge so far for the next governmentelect is to learn from its mistakes and where it got it right
how and if bolsonaros government will ensure healthcare is available in those regions is still to be seen

human rights groups and activists are urging the iraqi parliament to withdraw a controversial cybercrime bill that would greatly restrict freedom of expression online if adopted
the bill imposes long prison sentences for speechrelated offences that are only vaguely defined in the text of the bill
article 3 prescribes a lifetime prison sentence and steep fines for those convicted of using computers and the internet to undermine the independence the integrity and safety of the country or its supreme economic political military or security interests or to provoke sectarian strife disturbing the security and public order or harming the reputation of the country
articles 4 and 6 impose the same punishments for those convicted of promoting terrorist acts and ideas art
4 or publishing or broadcasting false or misleading facts with the intention of weakening confidence in the electronic financial system art
6
earlier this year the gulf centre for human rights warned
without a clear and explicit definition of terrorism it would be easy to use the law to liquidate the resources of political opponents and other activists
internetrelated rights are already on shaky ground in iraq
last summer authorities responded to protests denouncing corruption and dire living conditions in basra and other cities by shutting down the internet
if adopted the bill will only make it harder for iraqis to exercise their rights to communicate speak freely and access information online
earlier this month nine human rights groups including accessnow amnesty international and the the iraqi observatory for human rights published a statement urging the iraqi parliament to withdraw the bill
the law will result in internet users becoming fearful of exercising their fundamental rights and freedoms online and will empty the right to freedom of expression of its substance
the law would also have farreaching effects on the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of information as well as the right to participation in public affairs in iraq
the parliament was scheduled to debate the bill on march 14 but it was later removed from the days schedule
on twitter the official account for the iraqi council of representatives thanked those who contacted it to criticise some laws but did not specify which laws
rights groups and activists welcomed this response but they remain wary
small victory campaigning by human rights activists journalists on iraq and local and intl ngos successfully removed the draft cybercrime law from parliamentiqs schedule
next step withdraw the draft law altogether httpst

when the identity is revealed the agent concerned is often beaten up and chased out of town
the impact of these groups is remarkable  many security agents are now hiding their faces

female painters digital artists and musicians have produced works of art to complement street protests
they use art to honor the endurance of the people especially women
they make art to document the events and portraits of the victims and depict the reality of living under an oppressive system
women are front left and center of the revolution
when people started protesting they were like women should stay at home
but we were like  no
said islam elbeiti a 24yearold jazz bass player
fighting for womens rights in sudan
on march 12 the emergency court of appeals in sudan amid pressure from families of the women who rallied outside the courthouse scrapped the flogging punishment of nine female sudanese protesters that were sentenced to 20 lashes and one month in prison for rioting
flogging is a common form of punishment particularly for women in sudan  they risk flogging for crimes like indecent clothing or adultery
in 2014 a woman was sentenced to death for marrying a nonmuslim which is considered adultery
in 2015 a woman was lashed 75 times for marrying a man without her fathers consent
in 2017 24 women were arrested for wearing trousers a violation of the countrys strict sharia law
sometimes the brutality goes beyond flogging many sudanese women have been sentenced to death by stoning
according to reuters bashir defended his position on strict adherence to sharia law in sudan in 2011
we want to present a constitution that serves as a template to those around us
and our template is clear a 100 percent islamic constitution without communism or secularism or western influences
the sudanese penal code which is based on an interpretation of the sharia islamic law allows girls as young as 10 to get married and states that a womans rape by her husband cannot be qualified as such
on top of that women have to face morality laws that chain them and oppress them on a daily basis
for this reason sudanese women are on the front lines of the protests fighting for change

the democratic republic of congos constitutional court announced last month felix tshisekedi as the countrys newly elected president rejecting a legal challenge filed by runnerup martin fayulu who claims the vote was fraudulent
the dr congo held fiercely contested general elections in late december 2018 after the incumbent president joseph kabila who ruled for 18 years was constitutionally barred from running for a third term

the election was anticipated to be the dr congos first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence but has been mired in controversy since the december 30 vote

frontrunner martin fayulu of the engagement for citizenship and development party
filed a court challenge claiming the votes to be rigged against him
he and others believe a deal was made by tshisekedi of the union for democracy and social progress or udsp and president kabila of the ruling common front for congo party or fcc

on january 19 2019 the court rejected fayulus request for failure to prove his assertions beyond a reasonable doubt

according to the independent national electoral commission tshisekedi received 38
5 percent of the vote while martin fayulu of the lamuka opposition alliance obtained 34
7 percent and loyal hardliner emmanuel ramazani shadary garnered 23
8 percent
voter participation was less than half at around 47
6 percent

following the announcement celebrations commenced at party headquarters in kinshasa the capital
among several heads of state in africa south african president cyril ramaphosa congratulated tshisekedi and the united republic of tanzanias president john magufuli also tweeted his congratulations

following the judgement by the high constitutional court
i congratulate he
felix tshisekedi on his election as president of the drc
while congratulating all the congolese i beseech you to maintain peace and affirm my commitment to furthering our historic and brotherly ties
dr john magufuli magufulijp january 20 2019
despite initial disagreement among african union members about the election outcome the au has welcomed tshisekedi who gave his maiden speech to the union on february 10 to warm reception
but two months after the disputed elections many fear that this transition of power was staged carefully to ensure that kabila holds onto power through backstage agreements with tshisekedi
i welcome u
s sanctions on individuals for their responsibility in fabricating electoral results
in a spirit of consistency i encourage the u
s to extend sanctions to those who willfully benefited from the very corruption it is sanctioning and to those who orchestrated it

who is tshisekedi
félix antoine tshilombo tshisekedi was born in léopoldville on june 13 1963
his father etienne tshisekedi dominated congolese politics as the founder of udps  the largest opposition party

due to his fathers opposition politics the family was exiled internally to their home town kasai and in the 1980s tshisekedi traveled with his father to belgium where he earned a diploma in accounting in 1987
he earned several other degrees between 19912001 and worked in marketing

while in belgium tshisekedi turned to politics like his father and became the national secretary for external relations of the udps in 2008
in november 2011 he planned to represent the city of mbuji mayi in kasai but did not take his seat citing a deceitful election

his father was supposed to take on a leadership role as kabila transitioned out of power but upon his fathers death on february 1 2017 son felix tshisekedi was elected to lead the udps thrusting into him a powerful leadership role

the peoples soldier  opposition woes linger
tshisekedis victory may bring peace to the drc or explode into turmoil depending on whether or not fayulu who firmly rejected the election results can accept this transition of power

fayulu called the election results a constitutional coup detat and electoral swindle
in a january 14 statement from the roman catholic church one of the few trusted institutions in dr congo they said
the results of the presidential election published by the electoral commission do not match those collected by our observer mission
it is no secret that you have elected me president fayulu announced to the public considering himself the only legitimate president of dr congo
fayulu has been involved in campaigns for multiparty democracy and organized protests to this effect in 2016 and 2017

francesca bomboko director of berci international a research and consulting group in dr congo told the bbc that fayulu has often shown up at protests to oppose kabila
fayulu has reportedly said that the congolese call him the peoples soldier
when fayulu was nominated as the joint opposition candidate for 2019  albert moleka etienne tshisekedis former chief of staff told the bbc that fayulu could become the new etienne tshisekedi saying hes the one who embodies the real opposition

with the support of former vice president jeanpierre bemba and moise katumbi the former governor of the mineralrich katanga province fayulu seems to be rising in influence and power in dr congo politics

with no full support from party ranks tshisekedis victory came as a surprise
according to the international crisis group the udsp split into several factions some of which rejected the transfer of leadership to etiennes son tshisekedi

felix tshisekedi is also somewhat of a novice in the political arena
tshisekedi has been criticized for his lack of charisma and political experience in high office drawing his political legitimacy from his father according to simon allison of the mail  guardian

on the other hand tshisekedi is more diplomatic conciliatory and attentive to people a member of the congolese opposition said

he has promised to build a nation of unity peace and security

tshisekedi said on january 20 that the courts confirmation of his win was a victory for the entire country

it is congo that won
i am engaged in a campaign to reconcile all congolese
congo wont be of division hatred or tribalism
it will be a reconciled congo a strong congo focusing on development peace and security
patrick litanga a ph
d
student at american university in washington dc
speaking to al jazeera observed that tshiesekedis win may be the beginning of a new political landscape 
felix tshisekedi will be the first president in the congolese political history since the time of prime minister patrice lumumba to face a serious countervailing power
we may be witnessing the genesis of political checks and balances
dr congos future hinged on difficult past 
dr congo gained independence in 1960
since then citizens have been subjected to numerous human rights violations such as extrajudicial killings torture sexual and genderbased violence including rapes and abductions

uppsala conflict data project concluded that laurent kabilas government saw the next three highest conflict death rates respectively with 13884 in 1998 8019 in 1999 and 7537 in 2000
will the new epoch of felix tshisekedi government end the turmoil or stir up it lets wait

ahmed husseinsuale divela image credit committee to protect journalistsone month after ghanaian investigative journalist ahmed husseinsuale divela was shot dead in his car in madina ghana activists are calling for answers and insights into the circumstances of his gruesome death

the group united press for development staged a peaceful solidarity walk in accra in midfebruary as a message to police that divelas killers have not yet been identified or convicted
they say that walks will continue until the group gets answers

divelas killing calls attention to press freedom in ghana where violent killings of journalists are actually rare according to the committee to protect journalists

yet kofi asante the groups organiser says that his group recorded 31 journalists being murdered in kumasi some of them were killed in 2018 and the irony is ghana has been accredited as the number one country in press freedom in africa and 23rd in the world

who was ahmed husseinsuale divela
ahmed husseinsuale divela worked with tiger eye private investigations an investigative journalism outlet led by anas aremeyaw anas
their unconventional and controversial approach to investigative journalism has exposed many high profile people across africa

divela had recently contributed to investigative work that exposed kwesi nyantakyi former president of ghanas football association also a former member of fifas general council accused of accepting a bribe of 65000 usd
fifas adjudicatory council gave nyantakyi a lifetime ban from all footballrelated activities
anas announced the murder of divela in a tweet that included an attached video showing ghanaian parliament member kennedy agyapong speaking live on tv in may 2018

rest in peace ahmed

in september 2018 divela told the committee to protect journalists via whatsapp that some powerful figures in ghana sought to harm him after an image of him was published on net 2 tv station in may 2018 by agyapong

since my image was published and the public was incited against me  many people have attempted to attack me
these criminals after us are people who are  associated with powers that be in ghana and can do anything and get away with it
indeed it has been hinted in some quarters that the very man who published my image said he was doing everything possible to quell my existence
mps words have power
agyapong a member of the ruling new patriotic party has served as an mp for 19 years
in his fight against corruption agyapong is known for making bribery allegations against corrupt political officials  especially those within his own party

a debate ignited over whether or not agyapongs remarks on live tv directed at divela may have provoked his murder 
the boy is very dangerous
he lives here in madina
if you meet him somewhere break his ears
if he ever comes to this premises sic im telling you beat him
agyapong justified his actions and said his comments were not meant to provoke harm and referred to a skirmish divela allegedly once had with one of agypongs staff members
in another video agyapong suggests that anas is actually a prime suspect in divelas death
he offered to pay a 100000 ghanaian cedi reward about 19000 us dollars for anyone who finds divelas killers as proof that he did not call for his murder

agyapong left ghana after police questioned him  he strongly denied that he was fleeing ghana or that he has been identified as a suspect

six people have been arrested and released on bail in connection with divelas murder
police stated arrests were based on reasonable suspicion
however their identities have not yet been released

dangerous journalism 
tiger eyes investigations had been receiving death threats for several years and was accused of using unethical techniques that violate journalism ethics

while there is no evidence to show that agyapong had any direct connection to divelas killing his words do have power and were spoken on a tv station owned by him

a cpj report reveals that in 2018 about 53 journalists throughout the world were killed 34 of whom were targeted for murder in reprisal for their work
between 2016 and 2017 102 journalists were killed as a result of their work
over one thousand journalists were murdered in the last decade 20062017 according to a report by unesco
the high profile assassination of the washington post columnist jamal ahmad khashoggi at the saudi arabian consulate in istanbul on october 2 2018 by agents of the saudi government drew global ire
awil dihar salad a veteran journalist in somalia was killed in december 2018
salad fled somalia in 2005 fearing he could be targeted but later returned and was then murdered

earlier in july 2018 three russian journalists were killed in the central african republic while investigating the activities of the socalled wagner group a group of private military contractors
engaging in investigative journalism can be like signing a death warrant
many african governments operate in opacity and they firmly resist attempts at exposure
considering the poor remuneration of journalists it does not make sense for most journalists take this level of risk

yet divelas death is not forgotten and his work lives on
journalists and activists will keep walking until there is resolve

a billboard shows mozambiques president filipe nyusi
photo by dércio tsandzana used with permission
in october 2019 mozambique will elect its next president and its congress for the sixth time since 1994  and will elect provincial governors for the first time in its history
although the race hasnt officially begun it is generally expected that the eternal rivals of mozambican politics will compete frelimo the ruling party since 1994 and the largest opposition party renamo
it will be the first time renamo will compete without its historic leader afonso dhlakama who has led the party for over four decades
dhlakama died on may 3 2018 following a heart attack
dhlakama will be remembered as the renamo leader who signed the general peace agreements of 1992 with former president joaquim chissano which set mozambique on the path towards democracy
to succeed him renamo has chosen ossufo momade after he was elected by a party congress held in june 2018 in gorongosa the renamo base located in the central sofala province
he will probably be the renamo candidate in october and will likely compete with the current president frelimos filip nyusi and daviz simango  who presides another opposition party the democratic movement of mozambique mdm
mdm was founded in 2009 and along with renamo and frelimo are the only parties that have representatives in the assembly of the republic or hold municipal offices
daviz simango has run and lost two previous presidential elections
the october vote will also happen amid a ceasefire signed in 2016 between an armed branch of renamo and government forces who have in recent years skirmished with each other in mozambiques countryside
in february 2019 the national elections commission cne warned the public about the lack of financial resources to organize the nationwide poll
key dates
0104  1505 voter registration
3108 a 1210 campaign
1510 polling day
perhaps most significantly of all this is the first time mozambicans will elect provincial governors
previously they were nominated by the president
the shift is the result of arduous and lengthy negotiations between  renamo and the government
while the president hasnt yet sanctioned the law that will provide for this change it is widely believed he will do so

on february 20 vladimir putin addressed the russian parliament in his annual state of the union speech
he pledged massive investments in social programs and civil infrastructure notably the countys it backbone
уже в текущем году необходимо принять генеральную схему развития инфраструктуры цифровой экономики включая сети телекоммуникаций мощности по хранению и обработке данных
и здесь также нужно смотреть вперёд
задача ближайших лет  организовать повсеместный доступ к высокоскоростному интернету начать эксплуатацию систем связи пятого поколения 5g
this year we must adopt a master plan for developing the infrastructure of a digital economy including telecommunications networks as well as data storage and processing capacities
here we need to look ahead as well
the task for the next few years is to provide universal access to highspeed internet and start using 5g communications networks
improving internet infrastructure and ensuring that all russians are online may sound progressive
but these developments will come about in an era of unprecedented online information control in russia

in february two reports came out that noted a sharp continuous downwards trend in online freedoms
indeed it seems that while more russians will have access to the internet it will be an internet governed on the states increasingly strict terms
one study compiled by agora a human rights group lays out the different ways the russian authorities are clamping down on individual users social networks and online media
the most significant trend agora says has been a wave of laws and regulations that force internet service providers and tech giants to police online content on the russian governments behalf

on more than one occasion internet service providers have been forced to block access to websites for publishing information about court proceedings or exposing government corruption
in one highprofile case providers were made to block access to the website of alexey navalny a prominent opposition activist and anticorruption campaigner
agoras report says
власти подготавливают почву для блокировки сервисов которые считают основными катализаторами массовых протестов пытаясь представить ее как требование соблюдать национальное законодательство
делегирование полицейских и цензорских функций частным игрокам не только минимизирует ущерб репутации но и очевидно более оправдано с точки зрения расходования ресурсов и эффективности контроля
the authorities are paving the way for blocking online services that they see as catalysts for mass protests while attempting to present this crackdown as simply a requirement to follow national laws
delegating policing and censorship functions to private actors not only minimizes reputational damage but also ensures more effective control and spending
agora also notes a sharp increase in restrictions on individual pieces of content a total of 662842 items were censored in 2018 in comparison to 115706 in 2017
this includes blocked websites and individual urls online news articles social media posts deemed extremist or inflammatory etc

in a rare instance of good news one of the most infamous items of the russian criminal code article 282 incitement of hatred or enmity as well as abasement of human dignity responsible for the majority of prosecutions for online speech was reined in by an amendment passed in december 2018
this appears to have brought a decline in prosecutions related to online speech
however legal experts are skeptical about the possible liberalization of russian laws
agoras report predicts that public prosecutors may shift towards using other less severe articles in both the criminal and administrative codes to punish dissent
this could enable them to silence individual users and organizations while triggering less visible public backlash

agora also notes that western it platforms are increasingly acquiescent towards the demands of the russian authorities a trend that runet echo covered previously
citing googles transparency report agora says that in june 2018 google satisfied 79 percent of all data removal requests from the russian government while only 62 percent of similar requests from the us authorities were complied with
googles report shows that requests for content removal from the russian government multiplied by more than fivefold in six months in 2016 from 2045 in june to 11164 in december

to googles credit it didnt comply with any of the 94 removal requests from the russian government which it classifies under government criticism
google also provides some examples of the content theyre removing and a significant part of is genuinely dangerous to the public ads for illegal casinos scamming people out of their hardearned rubles violent racist propaganda online drug markets selling dangerous substances etc

but google readily complied with requests for removal of activist videos calling for rallies against corruption  because these rallies were arbitrarily declared unsanctioned and thus in violation of a pointedly restrictive law aimed at stifling public dissent

twitter google and facebook have all shown that theyre willing to remove content or make it unavailable to russian users upon receiving requests from the russian authorities to comply with the local laws
there is little indication that the companies take into consideration the exceedingly restrictive nature of some of these laws or that they are weighing these requests against russias constitution
another report by the internet protection society ozi is even darker in its predictions its titled the new year pessimism and it notes the longest and sharpest drop of its online freedom of speech index since the measurements began in 2016
ozi lists seven events that impacted the index in january all in a negative way from new pieces of legislation to landmark cases such as the prosecution of yana antonova a pediatric surgeon in krasnodar who was targeted for sharing a video by open russia an activist media outlet declared an undesirable organization

being associated with an undesirable organization  the governmentmandated list also includes the national endowment for democracy and the open society foundation  is an offence punishable by a law introduced in 2015 by a range of penalties from a heavy fine to a prison term
sharing a facebook video also counts as collaborating with an undesirable organization which antonova learned the hard way
the ozi report also emphasized the potential damage of the klishas bill which came as part of the package of restrictive pieces of legislation currently reviewed by the russian parliament
named after its author senator andrey klishas the bill aims to create a sovereign infrastructure for the russian internet ostensibly to shield it from foreign interference
the other an antifake news bill also coauthored by klishas is even more controversial and almost universally condemned by experts
yet both passed in the first reading thanks to the overwhelming majority that the ruling united russia party holds in the parliament

it seems that the russian government is finally confident in its ability to control online activity  so confident that it can now offer internet access to all russians without fearing the consequences
jolovan wham via twitter
the following post is originally written by holmes chan and published on hong kong free press on 21 of feburary 2019
the edited version is republished on global voices under a content partnership agreement
singaporean activist jolovan wham has been handed a 16day jail sentence for refusing to pay a fine for a public talk he hosted with hong kong democracy activist joshua wong via skype in 2016
he is out on bail pending appeal
wham is an activist known for his campaigns promoting the rights of migrant workers free speech in singapore and reform of the countrys laws on detention and the death penalty
last month wham was convicted of illegal assembly over a november 2016 forum he hosted on the topic of civil disobedience and social movements which featured joshua wong and local media activists
wham was told by police that he needed a permit for wong to speak but he went ahead without one
on 21 february the court fined wham s 2000 usd 1476 for organising a public assembly without a police permit
he also received a fine of s 1200 usd 886 for failing to sign a police statement
singaporean media reported that wham chose not to pay the fine and that the court sentenced him to 16 days in prison for failure to pay the fine
aside from illegal assembly wham was also charged for refusing to sign his police witness statement
he said at the time that he chose not to sign because he was not given a copy
wham intends to appeal the judges decision
he has been released on a bail of s 8000 usd 5906 according to media reports
the forum in question was organised by community action network a nongovernmental group concerned with freedom of expression in the citystate
according to wham the police told him it was compulsory to get a work permit and police permit if any of the participating speakers were not from singapore  even if they spoke remotely via video link
after the event wham was questioned by police for 45 minutes
he was finally charged in november 2017 but the case did not come before a judge until january 2019
joshua wong told hkfp that whams prosecution was an embarrassment and a terrible injustice and that he deeply regretted the judgment
jolovan generously invited me to share and exchange my experience in hong kongs fight for freedom and justice with the singaporean community  the irony is not missed here that jolovan has become a subject of injustice as a result
id like to express my respect and admiration for jolovans perseverance of his values and my wish for the singaporean people to one day be able to enjoy true freedom and democracy
stretching of the law
singaporean journalist and global voices collaborator kirsten han who was also a guest speaker at whams forum decried the sentence as outrageous
the forum posed no threat to public order whatsoever and the stretching of the law to declare a forum illegal simply because a nonsingaporean skyped in shows how broad singapores public order laws are and how they can be used to restrict singaporeans civil libertiestheres no sentence that id consider fair because he should never have been charged
han also disputed the prosecutions account of events
according to channel newsasia the prosecution argued in court that thousands were invited to the forum and 366 people indicated they were interested in attending
however han said the event only had slightly more than 60 attendees and was pretty standard
the venue wasnt that big anyway she added
blogger malele paulo also known as king faipopo
source facebook
samoan police arrested australiabased blogger malele paulo on 8 february while he was visiting the country to attend his mothers funeral
malele is a known critic of the government who writes under the pen name king faipopo
the police confirmed that malele was arrested for making false statements with the intention of causing harm to a member of our samoan communities reputation
in august 2018 prime minister tuilaepa sailele malielegaoi filed a defamation complaint against malele which appears to have set the stage for his arrest after he entered the country in early february
he was released on bail on 9 february and was able to attend his mothers funeral
in 2013 samoa withdrew libel from its criminal law as a media reform initiative
but the change didnt last long
at the end of 2017 the parliament of the polynesian island nation unanimously voted to revive its criminal libel law after prime minister tuilaepa sailele malielegaoi said it is needed to fight ghostwriters and troublemakers despite opposition from media freedom advocates
the tuilaepa government said the law will be used against anonymous bloggers and facebook users who spread lies and misinformation
the prime minister cited this law in his complaint against malele whom he accused of posting false information about him and samoan politics
malele reportedly wrote on his blog that tuilaepa committed murder corruption theft and gun smuggling
tuilaepa insisted that he is not against citizens expressing their views
i am not prohibiting anyone from exercising their freedom of speech or freedom of expression but i take issue when the rights of the innocent like myself are violated through lies and deceit
this kind of lying and attacking members of the community through social media is what the law was designed to prevent
after tuilaepa filed the defamation complaint his government sought the extradition of malele from australia
a police statement concerning maleles arrest also cautioned the public to avoid making defamatory statements on social media
the damage that defamatory statements on social media outlets and cyber bullying has done to several members of the community is a matter that these laws are designed to address
where complaints are laid with the police we will do our best to assist those being victimised on social media platforms by false statements
pacific freedom forum chair bernadette carreon of palau described maleles arrest as an attack on freedom of speech
focus on fighting corruption not freedom of speech
new legislation based on old criminal libel laws from colonial times forces samoa leaders to look backwards not forwards
another critic of the government blogger ole palemia criticized the decision to arrest malele
what the people need to know and always remember is that corrupt pm tuilaepa and all the politicians are public figures therefore they are subjected to public criticism  thats what you call democracy
maleles arrest has sparked intense debates in samoa
a news report surveyed the views of some citizens who expressed concern about the timing of the arrest while others agreed with the defamation case and urged critics to show respect to the countrys prime minister
malele is scheduled to appear before the court on 5 march
the 2019 nigerian presidential candidates collage by nwachukwu egbunike
nigeria africas most populous nation will hold presidential elections on february 16 2019
although there are 73 presidential candidates the race for aso rock  the seat of nigerias presidency  will be between two major contenders and candidates from the socalled third force a group of hopefuls who are relatively new to nigerian politics
the two major nigerian parties all progressive congress and peoples democratic party will of course be fielding their candidates
muhammad buhari president of nigeria

muhammadu buhari
the incumbent candidate of the all progressive congress buhari won the 2011 presidential election after defeating former president goodluck jonathan
buharis ascendance to power was based on his integrity and perceived ability to curb corruption and the boko haram militancy
however under his watch nigeria has witnessed continued insecurity with pastoral conflicts between herders and farmers as herders from the north move further south in search of arable lands
also human rights have taken a nose drive in his administration with impunity and corruption at the highest levels of government

atiku abubakar
abubakar is the former vice president and candidate of the peoples democratic party
he has tried in the past to win presidential elections but has not been successful
however his campaign received a major boost with the reconciliation with his boss former president olusegun obasanjo  who had described buharis administration as a failed government
as vice president abubakar oversaw the privatization and sale of hundreds of lossmaking and poorly managed public enterprises
a few other presidential hopefuls to watch are
oby ezekwesili image released by campaign organizers as media resource

ezekwesili the only major female candidate in this years race served as the minister of solid minerals and later education during the presidency of olusegun obasanjo between 1999 to 2007
she was also former vice president of the africa division of the world bank from may 2007 to may 2012
ezekwesili has been at the forefront of the call to rescue about 200 school girls who were abducted by the boko haram militant islamic group in 2014
she is a cofounder of the bringbackourgirls bbog movement
she is also the presidential flagbearer of the allied congress party of nigeria

omoyele sowore screen shot from cnbcafrica interview dec 13 2018
omoyole sowore
sowore is the founder and publisher of saharareporters sr an investigative online newspaper
sr has been described as africas wikileaks
this human rights activist is running under the banner of african action congress
the race is on for nigerias future
buhari and abubakar are the major contenders in this race
both men have been constants in the political arena in nigeria
on the other hand ezekwesili moghalu sowore the third force are a  group making their first entry into the partisan political space
buhari will be running on the gains of his administration over the past three years and must contend with the fact that nigeria was recently ranked as the poverty capital of the world
the punch newspaper described buharis parochial appointments as unprecedented and has left the country deeply divided
his fight against corruption appears selective and punitive
the recent move to try the chief justice of the federation  so close to the presidential election  was described by the nigerian bar association as a pattern of consistent assault on the heads of the two independent arms of government by the buhari administration
abubakar on the other hand is riding on the gains of multiple lucrative business interests
however he has an uphill task considering the power of incumbency of his major opponent
whoever wins the 2019 elections will face enormous challenges like the strengthening the economy internal security restructuring power and power devolution and ethnoreligious politics
editors note an earlier version of this post stated that there are 35 presidential candidates and has been updated to reflect that there are 73 presidential candidates

eissa muhamad from niger has been stranded at the bole international airport in addis ababa ethiopia for two months now
photo by eissa muhamad used with permission
eissa muhamad from niger says he has been stranded in the transit section of bole international airport in addis ababa ethiopia for more than two months starting on november 6 2018
muhamad 24 was deported from israel where he lived for eight years as a migrant
i met muhamad on december 12 2018 at bole international airport while in transit in addis ababa
muhamad tells me he has been deported twice from israel in 2018
when he returned to niger the first time muhamads israeli travel documents were still valid so he turned around and booked another flight back to israel
when he arrived in israel authorities confiscated his travel documents and deported him again back to niger
when muhamad returned to niger the second time authorities requested proof of citizenship but he failed to produce valid documents either israeli or nigerien to support his citizenship
muhamad remained in nigerien custody for eight days before being deported back to israel via ethiopia on an ethiopian airlines flight
when he arrived at bole international airport in ethiopia ethiopian authorities in collaboration with the israeli government  prevented him from boarding his connecting flight to israel
they informed him that israel was not willing to accept him and since then he has been stranded inside the airport stuck between niger and israel
i slept on the chairs sometimes i slept in the mosque i didnt take a shower for two months because the airport has no place for a shower i only wash my face my hands and my legs thats all
muhamad has attempted to contact the niger embassy in addis ababa but because he was not able to provide valid documents to prove his niger citizenship muhamad says they were unable to assist him
as of 2018 israel currently has 34000 african migrants who undertook perilous journeys to israel in search of a better life
but israel claims many are economic migrants who have put a strain on the economy
opting to stay meant jail time and significantly fewer resettlement options

prime minister benjamin netanyahu and the rightwing likud party remain focused on targeting those deemed infiltrators
israel democracy institute study says 66 percent of israelis support government policies to deport african immigrants

muhamad claims that he was legally living in israel and worked in a factory and told me the government took away his residency status and threw him out of the country
ethiopian authorities have not arrested muhamad and have provided meals for him while staying at the airport
technically ethiopia is a signatory to the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 protocol as well as the 1969 organization of african unity oau convention governing the specific aspects of refugee problems in africa and nearly all refugees entering ethiopia are granted asylum on a prima facie basis but muhamad told me he is not willing to apply for asylum in ethiopia

in this video interview muhamad explains to me what it has been like to stay trapped at the airport in addis ababa without a clear idea of the future
screen capture from a video of the russian ambassador giving his speech by africa guinee tv on youtube in frenchon january 9 2019 alexander bregadze the russian federations ambassador to the republic of guinea sent his new years compliments to alpha condé president of the west african country
he filmed the video greeting in conakry the capital where his diplomatic office is located  and in his speech broached a particularly sensitive subject  the possibility of guineans changing the constitution to allow president condé to seek a third term after his current tenure expires in 2020
depuis que la guinée est devenue la guinée dalpha condé elle est vraiment en marche
monsieur le président vous êtes un exemple phare pour la jeunesse guinéenne
malheureusement le principe dalternance qui domine beaucoup de constitutions dans le monde mais pas toutes heureusement impose la mentalité de revanche cest notre tour maintenant cest nous qui devons diriger le pays
mais les constitutions ne sont pas ni dogme ni bible ni coran
since guinea has become the guinea of alpha condé it is truly on the march
mr
president you are a beacon to the youth of your country
unfortunately the principle of political succession which dominates many constitutions in the world not all happily entrenches an attitude of payback its our turn now we must run the country
but constitutions are neither dogma bible nor quran
constitutions adapt themselves to reality he continued in condés presence making it clear that reality did not adapt itself to constitutions even for christians theres the new testament and the old
according to the ambassador all is well in guinea
and yet the facts reflect another reality
teachers went on a general strike this year that lasted three months unemployment is growing nationwide and guinea was found to be the chief country of origin for illegal migrants entering europe in 2018 with a staggering statistic of 13068 people
yet the ambassador went on
sous nos yeux la guinée devient le pays le plus électrifié de lafrique
dune année à lautre  on circule mieux sur les routes entre conakry et les régions guinéennes
before our eyes guinea is becoming the most electrified country in africa
year after year the roads between conakry and the regions are getting easier to drive
in an article for the newspaper vision guinée journalist pathé bah writes that ousmane kaba a former strategic adviser of president condé acknowledged in a public intervention
la guinée est dans lobscurité il ny a pas délectricité dans notre pays
cest pourquoi je me suis battu pour avoir largent pour construire kaleta sur le konkouré
on se bat pour avoir beaucoup de barrages sur le konkouré parce que cela fait avancer le pays
guinea is in darkness
there is no electricity in our country
that is why i have fought for the money to build kaleta a hydroelectric power station on the konkouré river
we are fighting to get many reservoirs on the konkouré because it takes the country forward
as for the countrys economy the finance minister estimates the level of growth at 5
8 percent for 2018 with an inflation rate of 8 percent
the african development bank reckons that guinea marked growth in the gross domestic product gdp of 6
6 percent in 2016 and 6
4 percent in 2017  but that didnt stop the ambassador from declaring exaggerated numbers to indicate growth
ces dernières années on a constaté la croissance entre 105 en 2016 et de 6 au 7 en 2018 avec le pronostic de 7 en 2019connaissezvous beaucoup de pays en afrique qui font mieux 
over the last few years we have seen an increase of between 10
5 percent in 2016 and from 6 to 7 per cent in 2018 with a forecast of 7 percent in 2019  do you know many countries in africa which are doing better
the ambassador added road conditions to his litany of praise for the president
however alimou sow an eminent guinean blogger shared a contradictory experience on his blog
je suis debout dès potronminet pour affronter en solitaire le tronçon jugé le plus difficile conakrykindia  135 km que lon accomplissait il y a quelques années en un peu moins de deux heures montre en main
maintenant il faut rajouter deux heures supplémentaires pour crapahuter sur la même distance devenue un parcours de rêve pour un rallye raid de type parisdakar tant la route est en piteux état
ive been up since daybreak to confront alone what is judged to be the most difficult stretch conakrykindia  135 kilometers which one could complete a few years ago in a little under two hours by the stopwatch
now you must add two more hours to crawl the same distance turned into a dream route for an endurance rally à la parisdakar so perilous is the state of the road
in 2016 members of the guinea bloggers association launched a campaign to draw attention to the state of the countrys roads and show their exasperation via the hashtag montronsnosroutes lets show our roads
the guinea bloggers association will start a campaign to denounce the state of the road in guinea
the idea is to share a photo on social media with the showourroads hashtag

the russian ambassadors speech has caused embarrassment to both civil society and the diplomatic community
guineas opposition leader cellou dalein diallo castigated the diplomats attitude in these terms quoted by balla yombouno in the newspaper le djely
il a été manipulé par alpha condé le président de la guinée luimême
et nous savons quil est le représentant dune grande nation dun grand pays qui a participé activement à la décolonisation du continent africain et qui a eu une relation exemplaire avec la guinée dans le respect du principe de noningérence dans les affaires intérieures  nous allons essayer aussi de saisir le gouvernement russe pour faire état de cette prise de position 
he has been manipulated by alpha condé himself
and we know that he is the representative of a great nation a great country which actively participated in the decolonisation of the african continent and which has had an exemplary relationship with guinea in respect of the principle of noninterference in internal affairs  we will be striving to contact the russian government to press this position 
speaking on behalf of civil society activists gabriel haba president of the citizen action brigade expressed  indignation sparked by the ambassadors support journalist ibrahima sory barry posted about it for aminata
com
la question de lalternance est une question de souveraineté
et la souveraineté appartient au peuple
il nest pas du rôle dun ambassadeur de dicter à la guinée sa destinée
cest de lingérence dans les affaires internes de notre pays
the question of political succession is a question of sovereignty
and sovereignty belongs to the people
it is not part of an ambassadors role to dictate guineas fate
it is an interference in our countrys internal affairs
the civil society organisation cellule balai citoyen citizens sweep up published a press release which read in part
la guinée vit sous le risque dun embrassement sans précèdent susceptible de découler dun forcing politicosocial en faveur dun 3e mandat en violation de lactuelle constitution mais aussi de léthique dans la gouvernance démocratique
cette tentative qui se fait de plus en plus sentir peut être source dune violence politique aux graves violations de droits de lhomme dans notre pays qui peine encore à cicatriser le lourd passif dans cette matière de lindépendance à nos jours
guinea is at risk of an unprecedented embarassment which is liable to unleash a sociopolitical impetus for a third term in violation of the current constitution and indeed the ethics of democratic governance
this increasingly palpable attempt could give rise to political violence with serious human rights violations in our country which is still struggling to make good the heavy legacy of this kind from independence to our own time
on facebook writer and commentator ibrahim marie sanoh wrote
cest fort abstrus que ce soit un étranger qui doit saluer les prouesses du pouvoir guinéen et plaider à ce quil lui soit accordé dautres années pour faire du pays le plus électrifié du contient le plus industriel du monde tandis que le peuple qui la investi manifeste une cruelle indifférence et ne pipe mot
its pretty peculiar that it takes a foreigner to pay tribute to the guinean regimes feats and plead for it to be given more years to make the country the most electrified in the worlds most industrial continent while the people who have brought it to power manifest a cruel indifference and have nothing to say
meanwhile the behaviour of other ambassadors attracted the attention of guinean blogger nouhou baldé
cette déclaration est tellement grave que le silence des autres nest pas à excuser si facilement
dautant que certains de ceux qui ont pris la parole par la suite lambassadeur du maroc le représentant de la banque mondiale ont dit ne pas dire mieux que le russe
personne ne sest désolidarisé de cette déclaration et aucune ambassade na publié un communiqué
this declaration is so serious that the silence of the rest cant so easily excuse it
all the more so as some of those who have spoken up since the moroccan ambassador the representative of the world bank have said the same as  that is to say no better than  their russian counterpart
no one has disassociated themselves from this declaration and no embassy has published a communiqué 
on january 14 security forces dispersed a demonstration outside the russian embassy which civil society organisations had organised in protest over the ambassadors comments
olusegun obasanjo former president of nigeria

as nigeria prepares for another presidential election in february retired military generals turned politicians are key to understanding nigerias political space
nigeria has been ruled by either former generals or those who have their support since 1999 when democratic governance returned
the recent public feud between former president olusegun obasanjo and the incumbent president muhammadu buhari  both retired military dictators  has a great impact on next months elections
in a rare open letter to buhari obasanjo has accused him of plans to rig the 2019 elections
he wrote
democracy becomes a sham if elections are carried out by people who should be impartial and neutral umpires but who show no integrity acting with blatant partiality duplicity and imbecility
obasanjo insisted that buhari would not deliver free fair credible and peaceful elections and warned that what is happening under buharis watch can be likened to what we witnessed under gen
sani abacha
in 1998 sani abacha a military dictator had called for general elections but it became obvious that abacha had no intention of handing power over to civilians
the five political parties at the time endorsed abacha as their sole presidential candidate
now deceased abacha became infamous for his repression of human rights and corruption
obasanjo alleged that buhari was towing the same path as abacha in mad desperation
shehu garba the media assistant to president buhari dismissed obasanjos letter
the elections starting in february will be free and fair as promised the nation and the international community by president buhari
obasanjo the letter writer 
olusegun obasanjo former military head of state 19761979 and later nigerias democratically elected president 19992007 has consistently criticized successive governments in nigeria
last year obasanjo had advised buhari not to seek reelection as president but to consider a deserved rest at this point in time and at this age
this advice caused ripples in nigeria because obasanjo was a strong supporter of the buharis candidacy during the 2015 presidential elections
prior obasanjo had scolded goodluck jonathan in a public letter written in 2013 obasanjo accused jonathan of driving the country to the precipice and allowing deceit corruption and mutual distrust to tear at the fabric of the nation
ironically obasanjo had also supported jonathans election in 2011
and in 2007 he promoted the election of jonathan goodlucks predecessor umaru musa yaradua
however obasanjo went against yaradua when the latter became sick and did not hand properly hand over power to jonathan his then deputy
former nigerian president goodluck jonathan with newly swornin president muhammadu buhari during his inauguration ceremony on may 29 2015
public domain photo from the us state department
retired generals never rest in nigeria
nigerias political landscape is held by retired generals or their cronies
obasanjo for instance has been instrumental in the emergence of nigerian presidents from 2007 to 2015
however unlike civilians  yaradua and jonathan  who he promoted and also criticized buhari is somewhat different
although obasanjo supported buharis election in 2015 he cannot fully take the praise alone
this is because buharis ascendance to power was made possible by his allegiance with bola tinubus defunct action congress of nigeria acn
buharis congress for progressive change cpc later merged with acn in february 2013 to form the all progressive congress apc 
in addition buhari a former military head of state 19831985 is a member of the club of retired generals who have dominated nigerias political space
therefore as harsh as obasanjos reprimand might sound a lot depends on the dynamics of the power block to which they both belong
obasanjo is not alone however in his criticism of buhari
theophilus danjuma a retired general had in march last year accused the nigerian armed forces of aiding the ongoing killings in nigeria
danjuma a former chief of army staff and later minister of defense chastised the military for taking sides in the pastoralfarmer crisis in the country but especially in his home state of taraba
similarly danjuma recently raised an alarm about plans to use the police and soldiers to manipulate the 2019 elections
similarly in february last year former military head of state ibrahim babangida publicly advised president buhari not to stand for reelection arguing that 21st century nigeria needs to tap younger generations
he believes that there comes a time in the life of a nation when personal ambition should not override national interest
but it may be a while before nigeria gets a civilian president who has no links or backing from the retired generals club

ten years ago on saturday 7 february 2009 victoria experienced catastrophic bushfires which killed 173 people injuring more than four hundred and destroying over two thousand homes
seven people died later as the result of their injuries
during the week of the 2019 anniversary victorians have remembered black saturday with mainstream media presenting many personal stories of the fires
abc melbourne the local arm of the national broadcaster commemorated the victims by sharing stories from survivors
others have shared their memories online
on her blog the small adventurer indya recounts losing her home and shares the impact of the fires on her life since that day
ten entire years and i still dont think one single day has passed without me mentioning  or at least thinking about  the fires
i am also still really really nervous around things like ovens stoves heaters and even lighters
as a baker you can imagine how difficult having those fears is when im going to take something out of the oven and suddenly something doesnt move the way i expect it to or something like that and i instantly freeze up and freak out
tomorrow i will be thinking of all those who had it much worse than me and hoping that the people who are still alive and lost so much more are doing okay
but i will also be thinking about myself and allowing myself to feel whatever i happen to feel because my feelings are valid too
my fear and sadness is valid too and always have been it just took me a while to realise it

elizabeth donoghue took the photo at the top of this story from a road that many people describe as a death trap a road that i have always avoided till now
but it was worth a hairy drive she posted it two months after the fires on flickr
now that everyone knows that this beautiful country that was so burnt in february is not really destroyed but is just doing what nature intended and is regenerating as nature intended let me show you this amazing landscape
it gives some idea of the scale of the fires and it also shows for me the folds and rhythms of the land beneath the vegetation
i took this from a road that many people describe as a death trap a road that i have always avoided till now
but it was worth a hairy drive

mozambican journalist amade abubacar was arrested on january 5 while reporting on a trend of violent attacks on small villages in mozambiques province of cabo delgado
located in northern mozambique cabo delgado is rich with natural resources such as ruby charcoal and natural gas found in the rovuma basin
some observers say the group coordinating the attacks intends to begin trafficking these resources
since october 2017 multiple attacks have been carried out in different districts of cabo delgado by what appears to be the same rogue group
many media have reported on the attacks but state officials have been unwilling to comment on or confirm evidence in these cases
in 2018 more than one hundred people were prosecuted together in relation to these crimes
their trial is expected to end this year
freeamade campaign to release mozambican journalist
amade aoubacar works with the mozambican social communication institute and as a journalist with news site zitamar and the local radio station nacedje
the journalist was arrested and detained by mozambican federal police on january 5 while photographing survivors of an attack in cabo delgado
amade was then taken to a military quarter of the defense forces of mozambique in the district of mueda despite not being a member of the armed forces
after a few weeks he was transferred to a civilian prison to legalize his detention in pemba capital of cabo delgado 
after he arrived at the civilian prison amade contacted the mozambican order of lawyers and reported having experienced torture at the hands of mozambican armed forces who he says beat him and deprived him of food
many individuals and media freedom groups have spoken out in his abubacars defense saying that his arrest and detention have threatened the exercise of free expression
the media institute of southern africa which monitors media rights and activities in the region spoke out strongly against amades detention
abubacars prolonged detention by the military is a violation of his rights as well as his arrest under unconfirmed charges
the mozambican government is setting a bad precedent in the violation of free expression and access to information in the region
amnesty international also released a statement
amade abubacar é um respeitado jornalista que estava a gravar depoimentos de pessoas que fugiram de ataques mortais em cabo delgado quando foi preso pela polícia
esta é a mais recente demonstração de desprezo pela liberdade de expressão e liberdade de imprensa por parte das autoridades moçambicanas que veem os jornalistas como uma ameaça e os tratam como criminosos
amade abubacar is a respected journalist who was recording testimony from people who fled deadly attacks in cabo delgado when he was arrested by police
this is the latest demonstration of contempt coming from mozambican authorities and directed at freedom of expression and freedom of the press authorities view journalists as a threat and thus they are treated as criminals
the campaign has also spread on twitter with the creation of hashtags like freeamade to advocate for the liberation of amade
unhumanrights demands immediate release of journalist amadeabubacar
arbitrary detention was no longer enough they had to torture him make him sleep with handcuffs at the military base without give him food
this is terrible

nyerere square in dodoma the capital of tanzania and home of the parliament bunge

on january 29 when the tanzanian parliament bunge assembled in dodoma for its first session of 2019 an owl flew into the building perched on the ceiling and observed the assembly from above
the incident drew national attention and provoked questions from social media users and newspapers
what could the presence of an owl in parliament mean

the owl has been spotted twice inside the halls of parliament in the city of dodoma
what does it seem to signal
bad omen the regional weekly the east african proposed

the british blogger and media analyst ben taylor went further 
the owl that entered parliament signalled the coming death of tanzanian democracy

tanzanian cartoonist samuel mwamkinga joune later illustrated the incident with a reference to the british term a group of owls based on the greek perception that owls are wise illustration used with permission
the owl is however seen as an omen of death and misfortune in tanzania

and  the owl was determined to stay in bunge according to the citizen 
the owl a nocturnal bird could not leave  despite several attempts by parliament officials to evict it
owls are not unusual in tanzania and neither is tanzanians inclination toward superstition
a 2010 survey found that 93 percent of tanzanians believe in witchcraft
no ordinary parliament session
for this particular session the presence of the owl offered a symbolism even for the nonsuperstitious which was too stark to be ignored

on the agenda for tanzanias first parliamentary session of 2019 were the proposed amendments of the political parties act which has followed a monthslong intense debate in an increasingly unstable political climate

tanzania made history in 1992 as one of the first countries in africa to establish a multiparty system which allowed opposition parties
the political parties act here with proposed amendments was also introduced in 1992 and has been amended over time with the latest amendment in 2009

with the owl perching above the assembly tanzanian parliamentarians agreed to amend the act  a step that critics regard as a serious weakening of the multiparty system in tanzania and thus also democracy

in short the renewal of the act provides more authority to the governmentappointed registrar to not only deregister political parties but also to issue punishments in the form of imprisonment if a political party for instance carries out civic education related to voter registration and other politicallymotivated activities according to reuters
several media quoted zitto kabwe leader of the opposition party actwazalendo who already back in august 2017 criticized the proposed amendment of the act predicting it may undermine political rights
kabwe then compared it to the media services bill 2016 which set the free and independent media back
now kabwe calls attention to the inherent contradiction caused by the amendment of the political parties act
you cant have a constitution that allows freedom of association then give someone powers to revoke that freedom of association

dying democracy
tanzanias declining democracy under the rule of president magufuli has been a recurring topic in the media including a popular topic for satire

on january 30 fatma karume chair woman of tanganyika law society tweeted a cartoon by the kenyan cartoonist gado september 22 2017 pointing to the role of tanzanias president magufuli and the death of democracy
good morning everyone
have a lovely day

in recent years tanzania has turned increasingly authoritarian in its legislation resulting in less space for critical political opponents and independent media
now critics say the amended political parties act will make it more difficult to practice politics that are critical of the president and chama cha mapinduzi the party of the revolution in power since independence in 1961
opposition is essential for a vibrant democracy
a strong opposition will check up on government and challenge it
if there is no opposition diversity of citizen needs are unlikely to be represented well
in 15 tweets doctoral student rachel mclellan walked readers through possible consequences of the new act and characterizes a situation where a critical opposition will find itself cornered 
so most of your ways of convincing voters are gone
what do you do if youre an opp party go back to the drawing board and come up with new strategies right well this bill introduces unprecedented oversight powers to the parties registrar that make that v difficult 5n
rachael mclellan rachaelmclellan january 29 2019
superstitious or not  those critical of tanzanias authoritarian turn found some wicked relief in the presence of the owl and the unsuccessful attempts to chase it away

the owl remained
speaker of the parliament job ndugai tried to tweak traditional belief with a pragmatic explanation 
honourable members of parliament we have been seeing an owl in this house since morning but in the tradition of people of dodoma an owl that is seen during daytime cannot have any effect on anyone
this means that we have nothing to worry about its presence

for the critical however there is nothing pragmatic about the new act

spread love not hate is the mantra that rang out during guyanas first gay pride parade which took place on june 3 2018
it was an event that allowed the countrys lgbt community the opportunity to step out of the cloak of invisibility and claim their right to be proud of who they are and who they choose to love

anal sex commonly known as buggery in many caribbean territories is still illegal in guyana despite the landmark rulings in the caleb orozco case in belize in 2016 and the more recent jason jones case in trinidad and tobago both of which deemed the criminalisation of sodomy unconstitutional
both cases were not without controversy and negative reactions regionwide  and neither was guyanas gay pride parade
netizens were quite vocal about their opposing views
in once facebook thread yolanda adams left a scathing comment that reflected just how much of a role religion plays in the issue
mr president stand your ground if you only promote this act the country will be cursed because god is totally against it
he has destroyed a nation already because of this act and hasnt changed
these are not the days to please mankind your first duty is to protect the inncocent sic children
because if you dont you will answer to god
so dont make decisions on votes god put you there not man
so please put god first
shanna leaona patterson was also against the revocation of the law
this government stands a better chance if they legalize small quantities of marijuana instead of antimen so they had better choose wisely
the guyanese term for a male homosexual is an antiman
facebook user brenda oliver had this to say
people just trying a thing that will not pass in guyana
guyana is not america
other facebook users thought the event was a blatant contradiction of the countrys laws and there was a lot of discussion about religious damnation
one commenter suggested that the country had other issues to resolve  race relations for example  that were more pressing
those in support of the parade  or at least those reserving judgement  appeared to be in the minority
for guyanas lgbt community however the event was a first step against the marginalisation they face because of their sexual orientation and gender identity
member of parliament priya manickchand who supports the communitys efforts said that people should be able to make their own choices and that the government had no place in peoples bedrooms
her statements attracted online support
facebook user shannon andre persaud wrote
i really cant tolerate people against the lbgtq community
what a tremendous step it was to see this embraced in guyana but not of course without the ignorant trolls
but instead of engaging with discriminative and uneducated people i unfriended and problem solved love is love  and this world could do with less hatred and discrimination and lots more love and humanity

there was also some advocacy on twitter

the parade is just one facet of the communitys fight for equal rights
joel simpson managing director of the society against sexual orientation and discrimination sasod who organised the parade had a message for government officials  the lgbt community expects to see action
however there is strong resistance
at a conference the day before the gay pride parade members of the georgetown ministers fellowship expressed their displeasure by threatening to withhold their votes during elections
the christian community comprises more than 60 of guyanas population and as is the case in other regional territories is lobbying against overturning ageold buggery laws
the fellowship even threatened to block the parade but with a strong police presence there were no incidents
simpson who attended the conference as a representative of the gay community indicated that lgbt citizens were still waiting on a 2015 campaign promise of legislative change
we are voting tax paying law abiding citizens like everyone we are not asking for anything special
we should enjoy protection from discrimination

according to premium times the elombahs were arrested at their home in nnewi in south eastern nigeria
daniel elombah was arrested around 430 a
m
at his home in nnewi on new years day according to his brother paul
he said they gathered from the officers that his brother was detained over a recent article that was deemed critical of the inspectorgeneral of police ibrahim idris
mr
elombah was initially taken to a sars detention facility in anambra but was later moved to abuja around 700 a
m
his brother said
daniel elombah told the committee to protect journalists that police cited an article published in opinion nigeria as the reason for the arrest
the article which was published on december 22 2017 in opinion nigeria and was not written by either of the brothers purported that nigerias inspector general of police was involved in an unending baggage of controversy
in an interview with the daily post inspector general ibrahim idris deflected direct questions about the reasons for the elombahs arrests simply saying that whenever you commit an offence it is our duty to ensure that we respond
daniel elombah who resides in the uk but was visiting his family in nigeria at the time of the arrests is know for his critical reporting on boko haram and president buhari

image released on facebook by elombahs solicitor obunike ohaegbunigerian journalist daniel elombah and his brother timothy elombah were arrested by the nigerian police on new years day
the journalist was released later that day and soon after was hospitalized in abuja
though no official explanation was given by elombah about his hospitalization it seems the journalist had to receive medical attention after being handcuffed like a criminal and transported in a bus over a very bad road for 700 miles to abuja
during the trip the elombah brothers were assaulted slapped punched and beaten by the nigerian police according to a news report from vanguard newspaper
police have yet to release his brother timothy
on january 2 2018 a magistrate court sitting in abuja granted a warrant to extend timothys detention
this would enable us carry out our preliminary investigations before filing criminal charges against him said a police spokesperson
nigerian authorities should immediately release timothy elombah drop legal proceedings and allow his brother daniel to return home said cpj deputy executive director robert mahoney in new york
police have no business raiding a journalists home and locking him up just because an officer does not like something written in the press
its not even clear that the man they have detained had anything to do with the article they deem defamatory
daniel elombah has sued nigerias inspector general of police for violating his fundamental rights in a high court of the federal capital territory abuja
he is requesting 2 billion naira about usd 5
5 million in damages for his unlawful detention
similarly three solicitors based in the united kingdom have petitioned the british mp lyn brown the prime minister theresa may and foreign affairs minister boris johnson over the unlawful arrest of daniel elombah

a rumor about the spread of french yellow vest protests to other european countries went viral on chinese social media before christmas
the story emerged after french president emmanuel macron announced a number of concessions to address protesters grievances over economic policies
while macron expected calm and order be restored the chinesefabricated rumor predicted the opposite
multiple versions of the story were spread via a number of microblogging accounts on weibo and wechat quoting sources from a commodity wholesaler in yiwua city well known as a wholesaling centerwho stated that their entire stock of yellow vests in stock was sold out and more orders had been coming in from european nations such as sweden prague switzerland etc
the story implied that the yellow vest protests were spreading throughout the continent
here is one version of the story that circulated on weibo and wechat
义乌指数中国义乌的服装调研报告指出现在来自欧洲的黄背心订单继续暴涨现在黄背心制作工作已经在加班加点地进行更有不少跨境电商卖家将此视为一次绝佳的销售机会不少网友说根据义乌商品市场的大数据可以预测未来黄背心运动的的浪潮还有可能蔓延到瑞典捷克瑞士西班牙等国早前就有外媒发文指出义乌具有一股神秘力量可以通过市场行情来预测国际政治大事件的走向在义乌接受的海外订单数量更被视为民意的风向标可以惊人地对将要发生的事件做出准确预测早在2016年美国大选的时候义乌制造商就通过美国订购的旗帜和衣衫的数量提前5个月预测出特朗普将会成为总统据了解目前义乌的一些纺织厂已经开始陆续接受到美国订单开始生产特朗普2020年竞选时的旗帜和支持者所穿的衬衫由于订单量已经比民主党竞选所开出的需求高出数倍因此也有人通过这点来预测特朗普很有可能连任美国总统这是中国制造的大数据威力
yiwu index yiwus research report on clothing showed that orders of yellow vests from europe has continued to surge
manufacturers worked overtime to meet the demand and many traders from overseas ecommerce platforms see the movement as an excellent sales opportunity
chinese netizens believed that based on the yiwu commodity index and its big data the yellow vest movement would spread to sweden czech republic switzerland and spain
foreign media outlets pointed out that the yiwu index could accurately predict international political trends
commodity orders from overseas market could serve as indicators of public opinion and hence could accurately predict the results of political events
back in 2016 based on the orders of election related tshirts and flags manufacturers from yiwu had predicted donald trump would win the u
s
presidency five months in advance
observers say that textile factories in yiwu have started receiving orders from the u
s and have begun manufacturing flags and tshirts for trump supporters for the 2020 presidential election
the demand is now several times larger than orders from supporters of the democratic party
some have started to predict that trump would be reelected
this shows the power of chinas big data
many retweeted the news with comments such as yiwu has become a base for predicting global trends and take a look at yiwus export data and you can become an analyst of global affairs
the myth of the yiwu index
located in zhejiang province yiwu is the worlds biggest small commodities trading hub and one of the most popular small commodities wholesale markets in china
yiwus international trade city has an index called the yiwu china commodity index that reflects market trends
during the us election in 2016 the yiwu index became a hot topic on chinese social media as discussions about electionrelated merchandise order records in yiwu seemed to indicate that donald trump was more popular than hillary clinton
after the election even stateaffiliated media reported that commodity order records from yiwu and alibaba had predictive power and many chinese netizens believed that the yiwu index was more accurate than the u
s election polls
some media observers were quick to point out that this interpretation was problematic as clinton in fact received more votes than trump but this analysis was ignored
this time stateaffiliated media outlet global times factchecked the online story and reported that yellow vests were not out of stock in the trading city and that the sales volume in recent months was not higher than last years
the global times report however has done nothing to stop the spread of the yiwu index myth
in fact new commentary emerged after the christmas reasserting the predictive power of yiwu index
the story republished on various online media platforms did acknowledge the erroneous sales figures for yellow vests but continued to insist that the yiwu index had successfully predicted the results of both the 2016 u
s presidential election and the 2018 world cup
the writer echoed chinese president xi jinpings december 18 speech on the 40th anniversary of the countrys reform and openingup which cited yiwu as a successful example of that shift
the commentary concluded that the predictive power of the yiwu index reflects the glorious history of the countrys transformation
实际上义乌之所以能够一次次精准预测国际重大事件的走向究其原因是义乌人通过几十年的奋力拼搏将小商品产业在世界范围内做的了独树一帜傲视群雄成为世界多国所依赖的小商品产地
在改革开放的历史浪潮中就是无数个义乌这样曾经名不见经传的无名小城在国家政策的鼓励扶持下刻苦攻坚努力拼搏敢为天下先使中国在短短40年里实现了史无前例的惊天巨变
the reason yiwu can accurately predict the trend of global affairs again and again is due to the yiwu peoples contributions in the past few decades
they have walked a distinctive path in the worlds commodity markets and established the citys leading status as the manufacturing hub of worlds daily necessities
open door and reform policy has helped numerous cities like yiwu to take courageous steps and strike out for success
their efforts have brought about the great transformation of china in just 40 years
this intertwining of the predictive power of the yiwu index with chinas economic transformation has made the myth even more difficult to debunk
students eating breakfast at school

with the acute lack of resources caused by the war in yemen a growing number of families are forced but to take their children out of school
girls are often sent away to marry at ages as young as 13
however one school in the capital sanaa found a modest yet effective form of relief
the ngo solidarios sin fronteras based in spain and yemen run almost entirely by volunteers and funded primarily by individual donations  some as small as one euro per month has started to provide a complete breakfast for this schools girl students who are aged six to 16
before the project began onefifth of them had been absent
little by little they started to come back and since september 2018 all 525 students are regularly attending classes solidarios founders say
ive spoken via whatsapp with two of the ngos founders eva who i had previously met in person some years ago in barcelona and faten who is in yemen
they told me about how their project breakfasts to educate and protect came about
they also asked me to not disclose their full names or the name of the school for security concerns
in march 2018 one of the schools teachers reached out to faten about an 8yearold girl who seemed to grow thinner and more exhausted by the day
suddenly she stopped attending school
she had not been the first to quit but she was the youngest
the teacher talked to the family they were in extreme financial need and had received offers to marry their daughter
when speaking with faten the teacher wondered whether a daily food ration could motivate families to keep their daughters in school
and the idea was born
faten says
most of these girls are daughters of workers of the textile factory which was completely destroyed in the bombings
the families havent had any salary for 3 years
how could they cover food expenses  the most important thing is that were supporting them to complete their education
their families are also happy as keeping them at school prevents them from staying at home or getting married at such a young age
in march 2018 the united nations declared the humanitarian crisis in yemen the worst in the world
with raging unemployment and inflation 80 percent of the countrys families are in debt and 65 percent struggle to buy food
read more in yemen war bad management and climate change are at fault for water shortage
solidarios sin fronteras consulted with a pediatrician to design the breakfasts menu
faten shops for groceries every morning and a married couple uses her kitchen to prepare pack and transport the food
during a 45minute break at work she rushes to the school to help the teachers distribute the meals
sometimes her siblings come to help out too
this doityourself spirit is true for the organizations three other programs
with food aid for families they distribute food packages for vulnerable families in the cities of sanaa aden amran raydah hodeidah al dorihimi and displaced families from taiz
water for yemen maintains water reservoirs in the amran and raydah camps for internally displaced persons and rebuilding socotra provides cement for rebuilding houses and dig wells in the island of socotra devastated by hurricanes in 2015
what if we do it ourselves
prepared breakfasts are distributed every morning at the school

it was on a trip to yemen eva took in 2012 that she met faten
eva was watching a birthday party at the next table at a cafe in sanaa and the birthday girl offered her cake
the girl was faten
they became friends and have seen each other several times since most recently in 2015 on evas latest trip to sanaa
faten remembers
a few weeks after the war began i was on whatsapp as usual and i asked eva can we do something to help
she answered that she would look for an organization in spain with her friend noèlia and i was to look for one here in yemen
eva who has 15 years of experience in international development could not find any grassroots ngo working in yemen that she could trust
so she and faten along with a third friend noèlia decided to create their own that same year
the three women are a volunteer executive team and count with support from trusted volunteers in both countries
eva and noèlia who are based in spain take care of fundraising they rely on social media radio the print press and lectures to spread the word about their work and attract contributors
most people donate online and ssf crowdfunds each project separately
faten is responsible for administering the ground operations  often from her own house
the three of them make up the executive team and juggle their tasks in the ngo with their daily jobs
they regularly share photographs videos and detailed updates on the ssfs social media pages
they also circulate content to raise awareness about the war in yemen in particular the role of spain and other countries who supply arms used in the conflict
