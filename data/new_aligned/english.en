The Official Portrait of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari taken by Bayo Omoboriowo via Wikimedia Commons, 29 May 2015, (CC BY-SA 4.0).
The Nigerian government announced Friday it was suspending Twitter in the country, just days after Twitter deleted a harmful tweet by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari that suggested the state would use violence against the Igbo ethnic group.
Despite removing the tweet, the message continues to circulate on social media, bringing up painful memories of a civil war that left more than one million dead.
But the tweet also sparked a movement on social media in support of Nigerians from the Igbo ethnic group.
In a series of tweets posted on June 1, 2021, Buhari threatened to treat Nigerians from the eastern part of the country in the language they understand, in a reference to Nigerias 1967-1970 civil war against the secessionist Republic of Biafra, in southeastern Nigeria.
The tweets came after a series of attacks on government and security installations in the region, which have been blamed on an armed group linked to the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a pro-Biafra secessionist movement.
IPOB denied involvement in the attack, says the Voice of America.
Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Nigerian Civil War, Buharis now-deleted tweet said:

The tweets reiterated comments made by a visibly irritated Buhari in the State House, Nigerias capital Abuja, about the wave of arson attacks on electoral officers.
I think we have given them enough latitude.
They have made their case, they just wanted to destroy the country, he said, appearing to reference secessionist agitators:
Buhari made the statement himself.
Buhari, a retired general, served in the army during Nigerias civil war.
The brutal civil war led to the death of over one million ethnic Igbos and other Easterners, according to Chima J. Korieh, a professor of African History at United States Marquette University.
For most Nigerians, the war over the breakaway state of Biafra is generally regarded as an unfortunate episode best forgotten, but for the Igbo people who fought for secession, it remains a life-defining event, asserts Nigerian writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani.
(Disclosure: The author is from the Igbo ethnic group.)
Twitter policy on hateful conduct prohibits tweets that promote violence or threaten people based on race, ethnicity, national origin.
Such tweets, like Buharis, are either deleted by the tech company or the user is compelled to remove the violating content.
Lai Mohammed, Nigerias minister of information, described the removal of the president's tweet by the social media company as very suspect:
Twitters Mission In Nigeria Is Suspicious, Says Lai Mohammed pic.twitter.com/6hbAKsnjVM
Deleted abusive tweets are still visible
An investigation by the social media forensic expert Digital Africa Research Lab (DigiAfricaLab) reveals that Buharis abusive tweet is still visible across numerous timelines two days after it was deleted by Twitter, due to Quote Tweets:
Over 30 hours after Twitter deleted a Tweet by Nigerian president @MBuhari for violating its rules, the deleted Tweet REMAINS VISIBLE across numerous timelines due to Quote Tweets!
Signing onto different accounts through different devices, DigiAfricaLab was still able to view the more than 17,000 quoted tweets made by users before the social media company pulled down the offensive tweets from the timelines of @MBuhari and @NGRPresident, both verified Twitter handles of President Buhari.
Furthermore, DigiAfricaLab was able to click and expand President Buharis deleted tweet.
Deleted tweets may still be visible to Twitter users because Twitter's software, also called, Application Programming Interface (API) relies on third-party applications that connect to Twitter servers via a URL.
Another reason, according to J. D. Biersdorfer of New York Times, was that deleted tweets may still be cached away and therefore available to show up in search results  until the site goes indexing again and updates itself with a fresh copy of your Twitter profile and posts.
Backlash with #IAmIgboToo hashtag
President Buharis abusive tweet generated a backlash from Nigerian Twitter users who trended the #IAmIgboToo hashtag to express their displeasure.
In addition, Nigerian Twitter users from different ethnic groups also adopted Igbo names to show their solidarity with the Igbo people.
An analysis conducted on June 4, 2021 by Global Voices on the Brand Mentions app revealed that in the past seven days, the #IAmIgboToo hashtag had 508 mentions, 319,200 interactions, 457,500 reach, and 313,100 shares on both Twitter and Instagram.
Screen shot of the context of mentions of the #IAmIgboToo hashtag
Human rights activist Aisha Yesufu  adopting the Igbo name Somtochukwu, meaning join me in praising God  while condemning the 1967 [civil war] threats from President Buhari to the Igbo people said that an attack to Igbo people is an attack on me:
My name is Aisha Somtochukwu Yesufu.
Any threat to Igbo people is a threat to me.
An attack to Igbo people is an attack on me.
I condemn the 1967 threats from President Buhari to the Igbo people
No Nigerian is more Nigerian than any Nigerian
Nigerian hip-hop recording artist and record producer Jude Abaga (M.I Abaga) expressed his desire for the country to move beyond these hateful statements:
The narrative that Nigeria hates Igbo people is an outdated context that will leave with the old and bitter generation
#EndSARS activist Rinuola [Rinu] Oduala, adopting the Igbo name Ochiaga, meaning leader of the armed forces, recalled with pride the important contributions of Igbo women in Nigerian history, referring to the November 1929 Aba Women Rebellion:
I remember the Aba Women Rebellion where at least 25,000 Igbo women protested against colonial oppression.
I come from the same land with those dynamic women, born of confidence & resilience to years of oppression & social injustice.
My name is Rinu Ochiagha Oduala.#IAmIgboToo
Blossom Ozurumba, Global Voices Igbo language translator, noted that violence always starts with dehumanization:
The use of dehumanization makes it easier to remove the moral concern associated with killing, discriminating, or torturing others based on their group identity.
If they arent seen as human, it is easier to justify acts of violence against them.
Dehumanization, according to Ozurumba, makes it easier to remove the moral concern associated with killing, discriminating, or torturing others based on their group identity.

On March 27, a heated debate ensued on Kenyan social media about utterances made on-air by three radio hosts during a breakfast show.
The hosts were discussing an ongoing court case involving Eunice Wangari, a woman who was pushed off a 12-floor building by a man with whom she was on a date.
On Twitter, angered Kenyans lashed out at the presenters Shaffie Weru, Joseph Munoru, and Neville Muysa for their remarks on the case of alleged gender-based violence, and called out the hosts victim-blaming.
Shaffie is insinuating that the lady who was pushed from the 12th floor of a building in Nairobi CBD after she said no to a man's advancements was because she was too loose & very available hence putting herself is such a situation.
What the actual hell!
The case divided online users as a section of citizens took sides with the hosts.
Although the trio was fired by the radio station, it brought to the fore how hostile the Kenyan online space has become for women.
There are about 21.75 million internet users in Kenya, or 40 percent of the country's population, according to 2021 data by research firm DataReportal.
Around 11 million of those use social media, an increase of 2.2 percent compared to 2020.
According to another report by Global System for Mobile Communications (GSMA), while mobile phone ownership is almost equally matched between men and women  with only five percent more men than women owning or having access to the gadget , only one in every three internet users in Kenya is a woman.
As an online minority, women in Kenya are often targets of cyberbullying.
And although in 2018 the country passed a law against cyberbullying  which defines the behaviour as interacting with others in a manner that is likely to cause [] apprehension or fear of violence to them or damage or loss on that persons property  with penalties of up to 10 years in prison, mass online trolling still runs rampant.
Below we'll describe two other prominent cases of the past 12 months in which social media served as a platform to harass women in Kenya.
COVID-19 patient
In March 2020, Brenda Ivy Cherotich became Kenya's first COVID-19 patient.
After fully recovering, she came forth to speak about her journey just as the world was beginning to understand the new virus.
But Cherotich didnt receive the warm welcome she may have anticipated.
After doing media interviews in April 2020, she was subjected to online harassment and backlash from Kenyans on Twitter (or famously #KOT, a term often used to describe the collective of active Kenyans online known to rally against various causes or personalities) who sought to discredit and question the truth behind her story.
Other online abusers poked into her personal life, and her private conversations and photos were widely shared, probably after being leaked by a friend or acquaintance.
her hairstyle looks like Corona itself
Angered by this, Kenyas Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe came forward to defend Brenda, calling for the arrest of the abusers and terming the trolling as a shameful bid to undermine the government efforts to combat COVID-19.
Health CS Mutahi Kagwe tells police to arrest social media users for bullying Brenda
That wasn't the end of it, as another victim soon fell to #KOT attacks: TV personality Yvonne Okwara was targeted for defending Brenda and backing the ministers advocacy for the arrest of online abusers.
I strongly disagree with Yvonne Okwara.
Your statement is not objective.
It is emotional and stinks to high heavens.
Speaking of which where was your voice when your fellow women stripped a MAN (Lonyangapuo) naked and shared his nude photos?
This is toxic
Okwara called out the abusers for targeting women.
She pointed out that Brian Orinda, the third Kenyan who fell ill with COVID-19, and who was present giving his recovery journey alongside Brenda, didnt receive the same treatment.
This stirred the itchy fingers of the keyboard warriors who had a field day on Twitter trolling Okwara.
Playing gender card everytime.
Women should safeguard their dignity in the first place.
Posing for such photos and sharing the same is equally immoral.
Kind of shallow and idiotic take from Okwara.
So shallow, you wonder if Corona ate the brain.
Nudes of men were online juzi.
She suddenly has selective amnesia over that.
Earlier in 2021, State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena also fell victim to Kenya's cyberbullies.
As she gave a press briefing to journalists at an event, online abusers body-shamed her over her weight.
It quickly became a social media debate, with a section of Kenyans and media personalities coming to Dena's defense.
Shes too fat, tall,short!
Who set standards for how women should look like?
Why is it our problem that @KanzeDena has added some weight?
Well, shes a new mother, but, she owes no one an explanation!
Give her a break please!
This is a new low we must reject
An article by The Elephant, one of Kenyas foremost digital publications, noted that online social network spheres in Kenya and globally have turned to be the frontiers for toxic expressions and harassment.
There is no gainsaying that social media has become an important tool for social and professional advancement, more so for women.
Many women have built their businesses online and, in the process, have learned how to connect with others.
Many find clients to buy and sell their products online.
Others find platforms to incubate ideas, leading to hundreds if not millions of social enterprises that not only spur economic growth but directly empower young men and women economically.
They have also learned how to improve their entrepreneurship skills online.
No doubt then, social media has emerged as a great space to do business.
This is important for womens economic empowerment and visibility.

It seems that for women to participate in meaningful online conversations about topics that directly affect their lives, the internet must become a safer place than it is now.

Caribbean nations have, one by one, been readjusting their law books to reflect greater equity for LGBTQ+ people by decriminalising colonial-era sodomy clauses.
In 2016, it was Belize.
Two years later, Trinidad and Tobago followed suit, but the ripple effect of dismantling connected pieces of legislation has been slower in coming.
Three years after the court deemed the country's buggery laws unconstitutional, Trinidad and Tobago's Equal Opportunity Act (EOA) finally looks set to amend its regulations pertaining to sexual orientation.
The Act's self-proclaimed purpose is to prohibit certain kinds of discrimination and promote equality of opportunity between persons of different status.
To this end, an Equal Opportunity Commission and an Equal Opportunity Tribunal were established to handle such issues but so far, neither body has been unable to deal with matters of discrimination based on sexual orientation.
The current laws only cover discrimination based on sex, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, marital status, or disability in matters of employment, training, education, and the like.
Pressure to amend the current Act mounted after Scotiabank Trinidad and Tobago announced on April 14 that it would extend its health benefits to the partners of employees in same-sex relationships, in the same way it already offered access to the common-law partners of heterosexual employees.
The announcement sparked a nationwide conversation and was praised by the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) and Ian Roach, chairman of the Equal Opportunity Commission, who noted in an interview with the Trinidad and Tobago Newsday:
It is a good move on the part of the private sector and especially by the bank, who has a wide cross-section of employees.
It is important that the others should follow suit, past what the law insists.
Attorney General Faris Al-Rawi has said he is encouraged by Scotiabank's inclusive initiative and remains open to doing what is necessary to address the spectrums of discrimination that exist.
Al-Rawi's stance is markedly different from his position after the 2018 High Court ruling; soon after the unconstitutional verdict was handed down, the state announced its intention to appeal.
While Trinidad and Tobago has undeniably made great strides when it comes to discrimination for members of the local LGBTQ+ community, homophobiamuch of it rationalised on religious groundsstill exists.
Public reactions to Scotiabank's announcement on social media networking platforms like Facebook were met with lots of criticism.
Meanwhile, LGBTQ+ people continue to face not just discrimination, but acts of violence, many of them ending fatally.
Most recently, the murder of Marcus Anthony Singh, a member of the local LGBTQ+ community, sparked online conversations about the reality that many LGBTQ+ people face in terms of both security and discriminatory practices.
Many of those conversations have been happening on Twitter Spaces, which provide an audio-only chat forum for safe discussion and education.
While Attorney General Al Rawi has not provided a timeline by which the amendments to the legislation will be tackled, for the LGBTQ+ community and its allies, the hope remains that moves by private sector companies like Scotiabank will soon be followed by the government, eventually leading to societal change.

For internet and technology companies, collecting user data remains one of their main sources of income.
But this business model includes a security risk for users, as demonstrated by recurring cases of undisclosed commercial use, massive leaks, and hacking incidents.
Is there a credible solution for strengthening users privacy?
Companies such as Google and Apple focus on collecting daily user data, mostly via smartphones, and combining information from the applications running over time: the user's contacts and agenda, for example.
A multitude of apps track the user's location in real time, while health and sports apps dig deep into their biometric information.
This data is collected and analyzed, allegedly to offer more tailored and sophisticated services.
In fact, most users do not realize they are offering a wealth of data to service providers and platform owners, free of charge.
Privacy activists, such as Austrian Max Schrems, have expressed strong concerns about this model.
They highlight the risks of increasingly frequent privacy violations and abuses.
This was perhaps best illustrated by the Facebook scandal known as the Cambridge Analytica case  in which British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users without consent, in order to provide analytical assistance to the 2016 presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.
Schrems says he warned Facebook representatives about the data-mining activities of Cambridge Analytica, but could not convince them to act:
They [Facebook representatives] explicitly said that in their view, by using the platform you consent to a situation where other people can install an app and gather your data.
But why would you care about privacy if you have nothing to hide, after all?
Whistleblower Edward Snowden answered this question in a Reddit discussion in 2015:
Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.
Real risks linked to the use of information technology platforms
French software engineer and data expert Gaël Duval has been involved for years in free software development, including the Mandrake Linux distribution  an operating system (based on a Linux kernel) which can legally be modified and shared with others.
Duval then decided to build an OS that would provide smartphones users with heightened protection of their data: /e/OS.
Global Voices spoke to him to understand how communication technology impacts lives, and present both an opportunity and a risk.
Here is his view on the evolution of such technology:
This is a philosophical question.
I personally have very mixed feelings about it because I've always been passionate about technology.
But at the same time, I feel that sometimes it's too much, and I miss the time when you had to find a phone booth to have a call.
It was probably a more carefree and [slower-paced] life.
Younger people might be surprised to know that until I was five, there was no phone at home and no television.
So sometimes I feel I lived a part of my life in a totally different world, that doesn't exist anymore.
On the other hand, it's really exciting to see what we can do with modern technology, like having an HD video call with someone on the other side of the planet, and seeing all those electric cars that, at least, are not burning petrol and [filling] our lungs with the exhaust fumes.
Besides the seductive dangers of nostalgia for those who still remember analog times, we are also facing a real risk of dependence on information technology.
A 2018 study linked behavioral problems in children with excessive use of smartphones, which was shown to cause issues including attention deficit disorder (ADD) and depression.
A survey published in 2020 by Common Sense Media found that 50 percent of teenagers in the Los Angeles area feel dependent on their smartphones.
The risk inherent in our use of such technology was recently openly acknowledged by insiders from the industry in the Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma, which includes testimonials from former employees of Big Tech  including Google, Twitter and Facebook  explaining how they purposefully nurtured user addiction for profit.
Some governments have reacted by upgrading protective legislation in order to both raise user awareness and place more responsibility on technology companies.
In May 2018, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The law adds multiple constraints to data management, such as asking users for explicit authorization for the use of their data and requiring companies to remove this data after a period of three years without interaction.
It also introduces extremely large fines for those who do not respect these rules.
But its enforcement is limited by a lack of resources to do so among local authorities, and it is, of course, only applicable in EU member states.
A tool to empower users
This current climate convinced Duval of the need to create a tool that would allow people to take control of their own data, as he explains:
Our slogan is Your data is YOUR data, because our personal data belongs to us, and those who pretend that it shouldn't are either against freedom and democracy, or they have a business that is fuelled by advertising  because personal data can help sell ads at a much higher price.
This is how the OS he created operates:
/e/ is a digital ecosystem that provides a smartphone operating system that doesn't send [to Google] any piece of your personal data, like your searches, your geolocation and that respects users data privacy.
It doesn't look at the user's data for any purpose.
It also provides basic online services such as an email address, some storage, a calendar, a way to store your contacts  everything linked with the smartphone operating system.
Duval said that when it comes to personal data, Google and Apple are in the same boat  this data fuels Google's business model, which is essentially based on selling advertising, while Apple, despite claiming to protect its users privacy, receives an estimated 8 billion to 12 billion US dollars each year to pre-install Google search on iPhones and iPads.
Duval added:
Using an iPhone, a user sends about 6MB of personal data to Google, per day.
It's double [that amount] for Android users.
Besides, Apple hardware is a closed box, without any transparency about what's happening inside.
You have to trust them.
We, on the other hand, support auditable privacy: all the /e/OS and the cloud software source code (the recipe for building the products) is open-source.
It can be challenged by specialists and audited.
In a context of growing dependence on smartphones, it is clear that protective legislation is not enough to raise awareness and equip users with the right tools and knowledge to protect their data privacy  and this is where a digital tool that makes users more responsible and proactive can play an important role.

Information and awareness is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Here in Kenya, clinical health care workers are sensitising the community on COVID-19.

Kenyas COVID-19 vaccination rollout has been mired by allegations of bribery, line cutting and corruption that have left poor and elderly citizens waiting in long queues outside public hospitals even as the country grapples with a third wave of infections and deaths.
Meanwhile, hundreds of well-connected Kenyans are paying anything up to $100 to secretly receive early inoculations, as documented through eyewitness accounts by various Kenyans online and news coverage in Kenyan and international media.
In early March, Kenya procured over 1 million doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine doses through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access initiative, a World Health Organization-backed global vaccine distribution effort known as COVAX.
The delivery marked the start of a campaign to offer the vaccine free of charge at select public and private hospitals.
The rollout was broken down into three phases: healthcare workers and security and immigration officials, citizens over age 58 and adults with certain medical conditions, and other citizens in vulnerable conditions such as those living in informal settlements.
The country is set to receive 24 million doses through COVAX.
It plans to vaccinate 50 percent of the population by June 2022 through a combination of COVAX vaccines and donations from other countries, reports The Washington Post.
In a press release, UNICEF Representative to Kenya Maniza Zaman celebrated the arrival of the first vaccines in Kenya.
With the arrival of these vaccines, UNICEF and partners are honouring the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the global rollout of life-saving vaccines, she said.
However, this elaborately planned three-phase rollout fell apart as soon as the exercise began because of a last-minute government decision to fast-track phase two in response to the third wave, conflicting politically charged interests, and the states failure to consult and inform citizens.
In his article questioning what is going on with Kenyas COVID-19 vaccine drive, Patrick Gathara, a Nairobi-based writer and award-winning political cartoonist noted:
Politicians loudly and self-servingly argued that they should be given priority to inspire confidence among the population, even though the Ministry of Health was reporting encountering little resistance.
Because the state had ignored the need to explain its plan to the population, there was widespread confusion about where and when people were expected to be in line.
Despite government directives prioritizing citizens over the age of 58, Kenyan media reported that businessmen and politicians not in this age group have found a way to get the jab early, exposing the country's rich-poor divide.
Meanwhile, eligible senior citizens and poor Kenyans, who aren't well connected and don't have money to pay a bribe, often wait in line all day starting at 5 a.m., only to be asked to return the following day because the doses are finished, according to The Washington Post.
They have another door for their friends, Mary Njoroge, 58, one of the teachers, told The Washington Post.
Without a godfather to help you through this process, what are you supposed to do?
A similar incident in another government hospital was reported by @_Sativa, a Twitter user based in Nairobi, Kenyan.
In a Twitter thread, he recounted the experience of his aunt, a retired teacher in her 60s.
While elderly people waited in line, a nurse called out names and young people came to the front to get vaccinated.
When his aunt asked what was happening, the nurse gave her a number where she could send money, he said in his Twitter thread.
Following reports of increased enthusiasm from the public for the vaccination campaign, Kenyas Cabinet Secretary for Health, Mutahi Kagwe told the media:
I think somewhere along the line we seem to have developed some confusion that anybody can walk into a vaccination centre and get vaccines.
I want to make it very clear, those carrying out vaccination will have to account for every dose that they have used and that dose that they have used must be matched against an eligible person.
The National Nurses Association of Kenya president Alfred Obengo pleaded with Kenyans who are not on the priority list to avoid queuing for the vaccine.
In providing clarity on how the Kenyan government could have avoided this confusion in its rollout plan, Gathara concludes his article by saying:
Much of this could have been avoided if the Kenyan government and its global partners, including the World Health Organization and Western governments, treated Kenyans as partners in the rollout rather than colonial subjects to be brutalised and exploited.
Sadly for Kenyans, their colonial state does not know how to act any differently.

Under 2020 content regulations, individual expression is restricted by exorbitant fees and the government's power to remove prohibited content.

This article is part of UPROAR, a Small Media initiative that is urging governments to address digital rights challenges at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR).
In early March, as Tanzanians began to speculate about the health and location of President John Magufuli, many citizens took to social media with their queries and concerns.
In response, the government issued threats of mass arrests to anyone who used social media to share false information about the president.
Authorities swiftly referred to Tanzanias 2015 Cybercrimes Act, and the 2020 Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations (EPOCA) to arrest and detain those who violated its rules.
The government has often used cybercrime laws and online content regulations to undermine and clamp down on digital rights and freedom of expression in Tanzania, this time was no different.
On March 17, then-Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan revealed on state TV that John Magufuli had died.
Soon after, Hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of Tanzania.
By then, at least four people had been arrested in different parts of the country for spreading false rumors about Magufulis health and location.
Many now wonder if Tanzania will review its repressive online content regulations in a post-Magufuli world, or whether these laws will remain firmly in place until 2025- the remainder of Magufuli's term served by Hassan.
In early March, Innocent Bashungwa, Tanzanias Minister of Information, Culture, Arts and Sports, issued a warning specifically to the media to desist from spreading rumors about Magufulis whereabouts, who had not been seen in the public eye since February 27.
Additionally, the Minister of Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Mwigulu Nchemba, also threatened netizens with jail time via his Twitter account for sharing nonsense rumors, specifically citing Section 89 of the Penal Code and Section 16 of the Cybercrimes Act.
Police Chief Ramadhani Kingai expressed specific interest in the Twitter account of Kigogo, a Swahili name referring to a high-ranking official, who often exposes government wrongdoing.
Human rights activists have condemned these moves and the overall climate of fear created by these regulations and subsequent threats of enforcement.
EPOCA 2020: Further restrictions on digital rights
Tanzania has experienced remarkable internet, communications and technological advancements over the last decade.
Nevertheless, the state often plays an influential role over Tanzanian media companies and platforms and independent media lacks diversity in terms of viewpoints and representation.
The internet created new spaces online for Tanzanias young bloggers and social media activists to make their voices heard, but the government has not welcomed this new reality.
In 2010, Tanzania first published the Electronic and Postal Communications Act, the first of its kind in the country.
By 2018, specific regulations regarding online content were released through Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations, 2018.
The government argued that these regulations were intended to monitor and regulate citizens use of social media, in particular, and tackle issues like hate speech and disinformation.
However, the regulations applied not only to mainstream media but to individual bloggers and content providers, who were shocked by the new requirement to pay $900 United States dollars for a license.
This includes anyone who produces live-streaming TV or radio.
The sudden imposition of fees turned Tanzanian social media dark as many bloggers and content providers gave up due to the exorbitant costs.
Opposition politicians and social media practitioners critiqued the regulations for undermining online media freedoms as well as civil society.
In 2020, Tanzania released revised EPOCA regulations, issued under Section 103 of the Electronic and Postal Communication Act, 2010, adopted in July 2020, and announced through Government Gazette on Government Notice No. 538.
There are several main differences between the 2018 and 2020 versions of EPOCA.
Firstly, the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) recategorized fees with three additional sub-categories under online content: news & current affairs, entertainment and education or religious, furthering imposing restrictions on individual content providers.
EPOCA 2020, Part VI, Section 116:
Any person who provides network services without obtaining any relevant individual license, commits an offense and shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of not less than 6 million Tanzanian shillings [ $2,587 United States dollars] or imprisonment for a term not less than 12 months or to both.
Secondly, the TCRA expanded a more detailed list of prohibited content including, among other things, content that motivates or promotes phone tapping, espionage, data theft, tracking, recording or intercepting communications or conversation without right.
Thirdly, EPOCA 2020 also reduced the amount of time that a license-holder has to respond to prohibited content violations by suspending or terminating an account.
Under 2018 guidelines, a license-holder had 12 hours.
In 2020, under Part III, Section 11, the response time is reduced to two hours.
Failure to comply within this time frame gives authorities permission to intervene, either by suspending or removing an account.
Global Voices spoke with several legal and human rights experts who have condemned EPOCA 2020 revisions, saying it undermines both digital rights and civil society protections.
They argue that these regulations further repress digital rights and deter bloggers and writers from owning their online content.
The biggest problem here is that these powers contain no safeguards against abuse, and with the current situation, they certainly have the effect of stifling legitimate freedom of expression in Tanzania, said one human rights professional who asked to remain anonymous.
Post-Magufuli: The future of digital rights in Tanzania
Under the Magufuli administration, civil, media and digital rights steadily declined with systematic restrictions on free speech online.
In the aftermath of Magufulis unexpected death, many now wonder about the future of digital rights in the country  after six years of increasingly authoritarian-style leadership.
Global Voices spoke to several government officials on the condition of anonymity about the current regulations and whats at stake in terms of human rights in digital spaces.
One human rights professional in Tanzania told Global Voices, on the condition of anonymity:
The regulations are not fair as anyone can be criminalized, because not many citizens understand the implications of these regulations.
Another suggested that the government finds social media to be an annoyance.
He warned citizens to take precautions when speaking out on public platforms because the government can legally access all their details through the platform host.
EPOCA 2020 makes it virtually impossible to remain anonymous online, under Regulation 9(e), coupled with the requirement imposed on the internet café providers to register users via recognized IDs, assign static IP addresses to their computers and put camera surveillance to record the activities in their premises, according to this analysis by the Media Council of Tanzania.
These regulations reinforce criminal defamation, restrict anonymity, provide hefty punishments for violations and grant sweeping powers of content removal to the TCRA and intermediaries.
EPOCA is incompatible with internationally acceptable digital rights standards.
Overall, these regulations stifle legitimate freedom of expression and press freedom in Tanzania.
Yet, the Tanzanian government is obligated to respect and uphold rights to freedom of expression and association of all persons  including members of the media, civil society, and the political opposition, according to Tanzanias constitution as well as international and regional treaties.
These rights are also essential to the exercise voting rights.
Tanzania is at a crossroads with digital rights.
Under newly sworn-in President Hassan, will the ruling Revolutionary Party continue to silence and repress digital rights in the country?

Article 11
Moving Tanzania forward could not happen fast enough, when President John Magufuli took power in 2015.

Across Tanzania, thousands of people are crowding into stadiums, airports, and curbsides to catch a glimpse of the late President John P. Magufuli, as his body is flown for week-long ceremonial processions in Dodoma, the capital, the islands of Zanzibar, Mwanza, and Chato, his home at Lake Victoria, where he will be laid to rest.
Magufuli was announced dead at the age of 61, on March 17, in a speech on national TV by then-Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan, ending weeks of speculation about his health status and whereabouts.
He allegedly died of a chronic heart condition:
Death announcement for the president of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Magufulis sudden death has, however, left Tanzanians, and others, speculating about the future of politics and power in the East African nation.
On Friday, Hassan was sworn in as the sixth president of Tanzania, making history as Tanzanias first female president, the first president born on the semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar, and Tanzanias first Muslim woman serving in the top role.
Under Tanzanias constitution, Hassan will serve the remainder of Magufulis five-year term through 2025.
In a short video clip, widely circulated on social media, Hassan dismisses any doubt about her ability to lead as a woman:
For those who have doubts that this woman will be able to be the president of the United Republic of Tanzania I would like to say to you that this person standing here is the president.
[applause]   I would like to repeat that this person standing here is the president of the United Republic of Tanzania, [and] happens to be a woman.
As Tanzanians mourn Magufuli and process this sudden shift, many have welcomed Hassan.
Opposition politician Zitto Kabwe, party leader for ACT Wazalendo, finds hope in Hassans history of activism and work as a member of civil society.
A very nice history of President @SuluhuSamia in 20 minutes, shared by herself [in her own words.]
She says she was an activist.
She was a public servant.
Thanks Chambi for making sure I see this.
Don't fail to listen.
Whereas Hassan is commonly known as a consensus-builder, calling for unity and calm during the transition, Magufuli was known as the bulldozer, a nickname he initially earned as Minister of Works for his efficiency in getting roads built.
Remembering Magufuli
Kanga honoring the late John Magufuli, Tanzania's fifth president, who died on March 17, 2021.
Goodbye our father, may God bless you / We will always remember our hero.
Many Tanzanians   and Africans  are remembering Magufuli on social media for both the bad and the good.
The Bad and the Good of Magufuli are equally undeniable, and it means the legacy he leaves behind is complicated but also valuable.
The pro-Magufuli and anti-Magufuli camps will never agree and the debate will go on for years.
Magufuli gained popularity early on in his presidency for his strong anti-corruption promise.
His efforts to boost major infrastructure projects and industrialization fed into many Tanzanians wishes for self-reliance after decades of international aid dependency.
Last April, for example, Magufuli rejected a $10 billion loan (United States dollars) from China for a proposed mega-port project in Dar es Salaam, saying only a drunkard would accept these terms.
This kanga promoted President Magufuli ahead of last year's elections.
It reads: Uliahidi Umetenda Tunatushukuru, in Swahili, or You promised, you delivered, we thank you, in English.
It illustrates Magufuli's achievements road construction (barabara), plane (ndege), bridges (daraja) and modern train (reli ya kisasa).

His anti-corruption focus also appealed to Western audiences, and the media initially covered his ideas positively.
To some, Magufuli is remembered as a true African statesman and pan-African putting Africa first.
Others remember him as a populist president who promoted nationalism above all else:
Been watching Tanzania mourning John Magufuli.
We denounced his autocratic ways, populism & sneered at his unscientific bent, but clearly, with the man and woman on the street, the fellow was quite popular.
However, Magufuli applied an authoritarian-style rule during which human rights and free speech increasingly suffered.
Over the last six years, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Committee to Protect Journalists, Global Voices and others have steadily tracked the deterioration of the civil and human rights protections.
Tanzania dropped six places on Freedom Houses scorecard measuring democracy and freedom between 2020 and 2021.
When parliament in January 2019 debated the Political Parties Act, leading to a restriction of opposition parties, it was interpreted as a bad omen when an owl entered parliament.
Magufulis administration often used legislation like Electronic and Postal Communication (Online Content) (EPOCA), or the Cybercrimes Act to clamp down on opposition voices and public dissent.
Amended regulations in 2020 prohibited citizens from sharing public information that may cause public chaos or disorder and content with information about an outbreak of a deadly or contagious disease without the government approval from top officials.
Citizens couldnt speak about an earthquake that shook the coastal region last year, let alone the pandemic that reached Tanzania months later.
And during the two-week period of wild speculation about Magufulis whereabouts and health status in early March, at least four people were reportedly arrested for tweeting about the ill president.
Did he die of COVID-19, tho?
Magufuli reportedly died of heart complications  an issue for which he had been receiving treatment for 10 years.
But Magufulis sudden death left many wondering if he had perhaps succumbed to COVID-19.
To many  not the least, Western audiences  Magufuli will be remembered for his COVID-19 denial.
Tanzania did initially impose restrictions and guidelines to curb the spread of the virus, but Magufuli repeatedly denounced lockdowns as a greater threat to the economy than the virus.
He actively rebuked international guidance on public health protocols like wearing masks, social distancing and vaccines  urging citizens to use prayer and herbal remedies instead.
After Magufuli halted the publication of COVID-19 data last year in April, he then insisted COVID-19 had been fended off by prayer.
Soon after, he declared Tanzania COVID-19 free.
Though it is impossible to say exactly how COVID-19 has affected Tanzania, it did not go away.
When a new COVID-19 wave reemerged in January, many Tanzanians shared testimonies on social media of becoming ill with COVID-19-like symptoms.
Knowing that it could be punishable to discuss COVID-19, people wrote nimonia mpya or the new pneumonia and breathing problems.
But Magufuli doubled down with his anti-vaccination stance in a speech from his home in Chato, on January 27:
If the white man was able to come up with vaccinations, he should now have found a vaccination against AIDS; he would now have found a vaccination against tuberculosis; he would now have found a vaccination against malaria; he would now have found a vaccination against cancer.
This was a major departure from Magufuli's predecessor, President Jakaya Kikwete, who served as global ambassador for immunization in early 2016.
Last month, Magufuli finally did admit that his country had a coronavirus problem, urging Tanzanians to wear locally made face masks.
It took the death of Zanzibars Vice President Seif Sharif Hamad, apparently, to break Magufulis intransigence.
Several high-ranking officials from the political elite and close to Magufuli have also died of the disease.
As throngs of people continue to gather to pay their respects to the late president, his death has also brought some relief.
Shortly after Magufulis death, writer Elsie Eyakuze came forward on social media to speak openly about what it was like to live through the pandemic in Tanzania, with a president who showed willful disregard for the coronavirus.
In a long Twitter thread, she wrote:
Now.
For the real story I have been at a loss to tell for too long.
#thread.
In March of 2020, the Covid19 pandemic started to rampage throughout the world.
It did not spare Tanzania.
But in April of 2020 we stopped all public efforts to halt is spread in the country.
In one of her last tweets, she asks:
Did he die of Covid19, tho.
Yes, he did.
And him, and her.
And them.
Tanzanians.
And beyond.
But they are not who you want to talk about is it?
They are not The Story.
It is.
A friend gets in touch.
Can you?
Wellcan I make it personal?
Please do.
I will.
Tomorrow.
In an open letter to Magufuli, Eyakuze points out the inconsistency of Magufuli's ideas, but also applies the empathy Magufuli himself seemed to lack, at times  and forgives him.
Tanzanians are coming to terms with the complexity and gravity of Magufulis death and the legacy he left behind  with a close eye on the future.

Who has the power to decide what does or doesn't appear on the internet?
That's the fundamental question posed by activist and writer Jillian C. York in her upcoming book Silicon Values,* set for release on March 23, 2021.
On Wednesday, February 10 at 2:00pm GMT, Jillian will join Global Voices executive director Ivan Sigal for a live video conversation about the book, which, as she notes in the preface, seeks to encapsulate the history of how Silicon Valleys major communications platforms created a system apartspecifically, a system that governs how we can express ourselves online.
Jillian, who is the Director of International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is also a long-standing member of Global Voices, where she cut her teeth writing about digital rights and freedom of expression in the context of the Middle East.
The session is free and open to the public and will be live-streamed on Facebook Live, YouTube, and Twitch.

The novel coronavirus was first reported in Tanzania in mid-March 2020.
But, after recording up to 509 cases and 21 deaths in late April, the nation announced its status as coronavirus-free in June.
That same month, Kassim Majaliwa, the countrys prime minister, told parliament there are only 66 active coronavirus cases in the country, but did not provide further details.
Since then, government has been silent on the coronavirus with a strong politic of denial and no data released to the public on infections or deaths.
Today, most activities continue business-as-usual, including Tanzania's tourism industry, attracting thousands of visitors to its airports with few public health protocols in place.
The airport in Zanzibar received the lowest 2-star rating on COVID-19 health and safety measures by Skytrax COVID-19 Airport Safety Rating, the worlds only assessment and certification of airport health and safety measures during the pandemic.
According to their report, new cases of the South African virus variant were confirmed in two travelers flying into Denmark on January 19, from Tanzania.
The highly anticipated annual African music festival, Sauti za Busara, will take place in mid-February in Zanzibar, with support from the European Union in Tanzania and several European embassies, despite the risk of highly contagious new coronavirus variants circulating in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil.
On January 24, the Catholic Archdiocese of Arusha issued a letter warning congregants of the existence of COVID-19 in Tanzania, and urged members to follow all necessary public health measures to prevent the spread of the virus in churches.
While Tanzanias recorded cases are moderate compared to other countries, the governments silence about COVID-19 data raised grave concerns among public health experts and human rights activists, who are forbidden from speaking or talking about COVID-19 in digital spaces.
The country updated its 2018 Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations in July, prohibiting any content with information with regard to the outbreak of a deadly or contagious disease in the country or elsewhere without the approval of the respective authorities.
Despite initial restrictions to contain the spread of the virus, schools, colleges, offices and other social activities are back to normal.
Even as the virus continues to spread in the region.
President John Magufuli had cast doubt on the credibility of laboratory equipment and technicians after secret tests allegedly performed on papaya and a goat gave positive test results.
The president said releasing this data was causing unnecessary panic and soon after, fired Nyambura Moremi, director of the national health laboratory, for allegedly botching the testing results.
The ministerial COVID-19 information team was dissolved.
In June, Magufuli thanked God for eradicating the virus from Tanzania, following three days of national prayer.
He made this announcement publicly during a Sunday service, amidst a praising congregation, making claims that God had answered their prayers.
He also praised congregants for not wearing face masks, despite calls from the World Health Organization to wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.
Magufuli, nicknamed the bulldozer for his tough anti-corruption stance, was reelected for a second time in October 2020 during an election that was highly criticized for stifling dissent and opposition.
Just before the elections, Tanzanians experienced an internet shutdown with access denied to all the major social media platforms including Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter.
To date, many Tanzanians cannot access Twitter without using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).
Over the last five years, the Magufuli administration has narrowed democratic and civic spaces and has cracked down hard on freedom of expression and access to information in digital spaces.
With the governments strong denial stance, Tanzanians are not allowed to release any COVID-19 data that the government has not verified, which means that ordinary citizens as well as journalists and medical professionals are barred from commenting on COVID-19 in digital spaces, or accessing information.
Access to COVID-19 information has become an elite privilege, according to one doctor from the national hospital who spoke to Global Voices on the condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal.
Unlike other countries with established COVID-19 information response teams who give daily updates on COVID-19, Tanzania simply offers a website with limited and outdated COVID-19 information.
The denial has been so convincing that its now widely accepted by Tanzanians, including medical experts, who disregard basic safety measures like wearing face masks and social distancing.
Global Voices visited major hospitals such Muhimbili, the government referral hospital in Dar es Salaam, the cultural capital, as well as Benjamin Mkapa Hospital in Dodoma, the political capital, and witnessed very few measures taken to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease.
People are allowed to enter hospital premises without wearing masks, there are few working hygiene and washing facilities and those that do exist lack water or are broken, which was witnessed, for example, in the pregnant mothers clinic at Muhimbili.
While the Magufuli administration has shown little concern about the impact of the virus on everyday citizens, many government ministries and departments acknowledge that COVID-19 still exists.
Tanzania's minister of finance urges ministry staff to take all precautions against the coronavirus, while also saying COVID-19 is not an issue in Tanzania.
Screenshot from Mwananchi newspaper.
For example, when Magufuli was sworn in for the second time last year, authorities did practice COVID-19 prevention measures, requiring all attendees to have their temperatures taken and wash their hands at hygiene stations with hand sanitizer provided.
On January 25, Tanzania's Minister of Finance Dr. Philip Mpango urged his staff to take precautions against COVID-19 while at the same denying its existence in Tanzania, during a meeting in Dodoma, the capital.
Most in-country experts are afraid to speak up, fearing retaliation.
Global Voices spoke with one medical expert who believed Tanzania may be experiencing a second wave of the outbreak but that this information was kept secret from the public.
The expert did not want to be named, fearing reprisal.
Another medical expert told Global Voices under the conditions of anonymity that people must know their COVID-19 status so that they can take measures to prevent its spread in their communities.
He said that leaving people uninformed makes their job very difficult and hopes that all Tanzanians will try to protect themselves by taking all precautions advised by WHO.
He told Global Voices:
Politicians have taken over the whole COVID[-19] issue and they are playing a dangerous game, but when people will start dying they will start sacking medical staff.
Another doctor who spoke to Global Voices anonymously said that although there is some hope in getting a vaccine, Tanzanias denial may slow down access to it, as the government has not taken any steps to acquire it on the global market, opting instead to invest in herbal remedies.
In December 2020, Health Minister spokesman Gerald Chamii cast doubt on global vaccines, telling the East African:
It takes not less than six months to find a vaccine or cure for a certain disease.
We have fared on our own since the pandemic spread, I am not sure if it is wise to have a vaccine imported and distributed to the citizens without undertaking clinical testing to approve if it is safe for our people.
Access to information is essential to democracy and development.
Tanzanias cyber laws have been abused to target dissenting voices and those who have spoken out against Tanzanias handling of COVID-19.
Freedom of expression, including the right to access, receive and impart information, is enshrined in international law.
In Tanzania, the right to be informed, and to access and disseminate information, is recognized in Articles 18(1) and 18(2) of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania.
Nevertheless, these rights are more cosmetic than based in reality.
With full-throttled COVID-19 denial and laws in place to prevent the open exchange of information and opinions on the disease on- and offline, Tanzanians are left with severely limited access to information and many are afraid to speak out.
This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights under lockdowns and beyond during the COVID-19 pandemic in nine African countries: Uganda, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Algeria, Nigeria, Namibia, Tunisia, Tanzania and Ethiopia.
The project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights Fund of The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA).

A document from the Mozambican Police (PRM) that has leaked in local media in early August revealed that 15 students had become pregnant at a police training school in Matalane, a district of Maputo province.
The document states that the pregnancies resulted from the students sexual relations with their instructors, without specifying whether these relations were consensual.
Moreover, it states that pregnant students will not be able to complete the course at present, and will have their trips back to their home provinces paid for by the police.
Finally, it says that the instructors involved will be suspended.
When asked about the case by the newspaper O País on August 8, Police Commander General Bernardino Rafael said that those involved would face disciplinary proceedings.
It did not take long before the case was widely condemned on social media.
Several users publicly expressed their disapproval of the school's measures, as well as demanding justice for the women.
Activist Fátima Mimbire wrote on Facebook:
Treat the Matalane issue with the appropriate seriousness.
I am heartbroken by this news of 15 pregnant students at the Matalane Training Centre.
This is serious.
It is serious because, as the document itself states, it involves the instructors.
Now, one person who holds authority over another gets them pregnant, and the outcome is a little process?
This reminds me of the teacher who demanded sex from students in exchange for grades or not to be humiliated in class because, in the teacher's view, they were dumb, instead of being prosecuted he was transferred to teach somewhere else.
And there, he continues his exploits.
Txeka, a women's activist collective, also condemned the affair on Twitter:
The Matalane case
Building a society of social justice, in defence of equal rights for citizens, requires a balanced education and development policy, valuing the development of citizens, with scientific knowledge and moral, civic and patriotic education.
The Matalane case
Blaming violence on women is a common practice in chauvinist/patriarchal societies, known for devaluing women and submission to the wishes of men, resulting in judgements about the victim's conduct and minimizing the aggressor's conduct.
University Professor Carlos Serra said:
Matalane?
Just the tip of the Iceberg, we are programmed to reproduce Matalane.
I imagine the day they start telling their stories, starting from the tenderest childhood.
It was similar for the journalist and activist Selma Inocência:
Few teachers are brought to court, tried and sentenced.
They are responsible for the lost childhood of thousands of girls.
School is not safe.
Statistics reveal that hundreds of girls get pregnant at school, some by tutors, teachers, headmasters.
A petition is also running demanding punishment for the police officers involved.
So far, over 3,800 people have signed it.
For the government, this case is serious and is being investigated in detail at ministerial level and by the General Police Command of the Republic of Mozambique.
The state should not and will not tolerate situations like this.
The law must be upheld and it is the same for all of us.
Nobody is above the law.
Investigations are underway to assess the details of each case, seeking to safeguard the psychological and emotional state of the pregnant women, because they deserve humane respect
Other cases
This adds to the cases of violence faced by Mozambican women, most of which go unreported by media.
Among the cases that have recently captured media attention is that of Alberto Niquice, deputy for the party Liberation Front of Mozambique (Frelimo), who's facing criminal charges for raping a 13-year-old child in 2018.
Early this year, 30 Mozambican civil society organizations demanded the suspension of Niquice's inauguration, who was re-elected in 2019.
However, the deputy took office and is working as normal in the Assembly of the Republic.
Another case covered in the press was the case of domestic violence suffered by Josina Machel, daughter of Mozambique's first president, Samora Machel.
In October 2015, Josina was assaulted by her partner of three years, Rofino Licuco, leaving her blind in one eye.
Licuco was sentenced to 3 years and 4 months in prison, as well as to pay 300 million meticais (about US$4.2 million) in compensation to Josina.
However, Rofino appealed the sentence and, in June this year, the High Court of Appeals overturned it on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence in the case.

African leaders have taken decisive, early actions to curb the spread of COVID-19.
In fact, the Africa Centers for Disease Control (ACDC) created its COVID-19 task force on February 5, before the continent had a single case.
Today, Africa is currently the least impacted region in the world, with 1,293,048 confirmed COVID-19 cases so far and a remarkable 1,031,905 recoveries, according to the Africa CDCP.
The continent has less than 5 percent of reported cases and less than 1 percent of all deaths.
Now, as African countries  led by the African Union   ease COVID-19 restrictions and prepare to reopen their economies and borders, many governments are employing innovative technologies.
A need for a unified, pan-African technology that can track the spread and connect COVID-19 testing centers across the continent has led to the use of PanaBIOS, an African Union-backed biosurveillance technology.
PanaBIOS provides a mobile and web-based app that uses algorithms to track and trace persons facing potential health threats and track and keep records of test samples from their origin to in-country labs.
The technology was developed by Koldchain, a Kenyan startup, and funded by AfroChampions, a public-private partnership designed to galvanize African resources and institutions to support the emergence and success of the African private sector.
Ghana is currently the only African country using PanaBIOS technology as it reopens its borders.
PanaBIOS ensures that travelers are able to use test results from one country to satisfy port clearance requirements in another country through their personal PanaBios app or by adding a system-generated SMS/USSD passcode to another travel document.
Port health officials use the enterprise version of the app to validate health declarations in a uniform manner across countries.
Comprehensive data protection and privacy laws
The African Union and the Africa CDCP are encouraging member states to integrate the mobile-based PanaBIOS platform that would allow results from facilities across the continent to be centralized.
However, digital health interventions have raised a lot of questions regarding data access and data privacy.
Government-implemented surveillance and control can instill fear and threaten civil liberties, especially in a continent where only 27 countries out of 54 in Africa have fully functioning data protection and privacy laws.
Some African countries, such as Ghana, have triggered new legislation giving the president emergency powers to fight the pandemic by ordering telecom companies to provide it with personal customer details such as subscriber database, subscriber cell reference data, uncashed subscriber mobile money transfer data, mobile money merchant codes, and addresses.
To ensure data protection and privacy, all machine learning techniques used by PanaBIOS are on aggregated data.
That is  data gathered is summarized for statistical analysis  not personal data used to target individuals  unless its for contact tracing purposes, where it would be required to reach out to suspected or infected people.
To ensure the prevention of privacy infringement, the African Union, PanaBIOS, and its partners must propose how it will comply with various country-based data protection laws to protect privacy, ensure data consent and avoid data sharing for commercial use.
The app currently does not have a privacy policy available to the public, in which it explains to users its data collection and sharing practices.
The challenge is how such data privacy policy will meet the various, continental, national, and regional data protection laws such as the African Unions Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection, the Southern African Development Communitys (SADC) model law on data protection, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Supplementary Act A/SA.1/01/10 on Personal Data Protection Within ECOWAS and the East African Communitys Framework for Cyberlaws.
Tech-based solutions contribute to Africas COVID-19 success
In addition to PanaBIOS, various African nations have activated tech-based responses to the COVID-19 crisis to mitigate its spread.
For example, scientists from Senegal developed a $1 COVID-19 test kit and 3D ventilators for patients.
Wellvis, a Nigerian startup, created the COVID-19 Triage Tool, a free online tool to help users self-assess their coronavirus risk category based on their symptoms and their exposure history.
The South African government used Whatsapp to provide an interactive chatbot that can answer common queries about COVID-19 myths, symptoms, and treatment.
And in Uganda, market women used the Market Garden app to sell their goods from their homes through the app, and then motorcycle taxis deliver the goods to customers.
Africas successful control and management of the spread of COVID-19 has been attributed to its younger population, limited testing capacity and mortality tracking, and the possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies found in some Africans.
However, it is clear that Africas tech-based innovations are a major contributing factor to its success in controlling COVID-19, in addition to decisive leadership early on in the pandemic.
Solomon Zewdu, deputy doctor with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation summarized how, in January, even as many Western nations hesitated, Ethiopia began intensive screening at Addis Ababa airport.
Rwanda became the first African nation to lock down on March 21, and many other African countries soon followed: South Africa implemented its comprehensive lockdown when it had only 400 cases and two fatalities.
(With a similar-sized population, Italy had more than 9,000 cases and 400 deaths when it acted.)
In contrast, the number of infected cases and deaths in the US is six times that of Africa.
Public health experts predicted that the pandemic would horribly affect the continent with bodies lying in the streets.
Clearly, Africa has proven otherwise.

Since September 22, news reports and social media posts circulating on the Chinese-speaking internet inaccurately claim that World Health Organization (WHO) Chief Scientist, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said Chinas COVID-19 vaccines have proved to have an effect.
These reports and posts cite as a source a one-minute video produced by China Central Television for the Chinese video-sharing app Miaopai.
The video shows a speech by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the importance of the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, followed by remarks by Dr. Swaminathan.
In the CCTV video, whose captions say WHO chief scientist: Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have proved to have an effect (), this is Swaminathan's speech:
As you know, they also have a very active vaccine development programme and several of their vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of clinical trial, so this is also of interest to us, so we're following those very closely.
Some of their candidates actually prove to be successful in the clinical trials that are going on.
However, Dr. Swaminathan's original speech has been edited.
Her last sentence, in reality, began with the word if, and the video's background music makes it sound as if she's saying proved instead of prove.
Dr. Swaminathan's complete remarks are the following:
We've been engaged in discussions with China for the last several months because, as you know, they also have a very active vaccine development programme and several of their vaccine candidates are in advanced stages of clinical trial so this is also of interest to us so we're following those very closely.
We've had very constructive and open discussions with them and they have always been reiterating their commitment to global access if some of their candidates actually prove to be successful in the clinical trials that are going on [emphasis added].
So I think the conversations are going on, it's still open and we're hopeful that more countries are going to join.
The remarks were delivered at a WHO virtual press conference that took place on September 21.
The complete transcripts of the one hour and 30 minutes event can be accessed here.
The conference aimed to present updates on the 18-billion-USD initiative by WHO and other organizations to deploy a future COVID-19 vaccine around the world.
So far, 156 countries have signed up for the program; neither China nor the U.S. is among them.
As anticipated, CCTV's video, as well as the news reports and posts that it generated, have attracted a lot of patriotic endorsements.
A post on Weibo by Daily Economic News has more than 337,000 likes.
Below are some of the most popular comments:
I am so proud of you, my country.
This is the best present for the National Day and Mid Autumn Festival.
You cant imagine Chinas speed.
I am so proud of my mother country.
China saves the whole world.
After fact-checkers pointed out that Dr. Swaminathans words had been distorted, some media outlets, including CGTN and CCTV, deleted their social media posts.
Among them is the Communist Youth League of China, whose post was captured by Twitter user @Emi2020JP before it disappeared from Weibo:
Tedros should have the vaccine injection first.
Like @Emi2020JP, many Twitter users believed that WHO was assisting China with distorting the video, and posted angry comments at Tedros:
Tedros is a toilet brush!
I will pay to give Tedros a few extra injection!
Yesterday my mom told me, the domestic news said that the U.S will buy huge amount of vaccines from China.
Let them live in their fantasy.
Such excellent service, from covering up the spread of the virus to marketing China's vaccines!
Although Chinese many posts have been deleted, copy-cats are still circulating on social media, such as this public post on WeChat.
Pro-Beijing media outlets in Hong Kong, such as Speak Out HK (and Today Review (), have also published news stories based on the video.
There are almost 200 COVID-19 vaccines in different stages of clinical trials around the world, and several of those are being produced by Chinese laboratories.
None of them has successfully passed a phase 3 trial yet.

Demonstration against the death of doctor Silvio Dala in Luanda.

Hundreds of Angolans took to the streets on September 12 in Luanda, Benguela, and in cities in 15 other provinces against police violence.
The demonstrations took place following the shock from the news that Silvio Dala, a 35-year-old doctor, lost his life on September 1 while in police custody.
According to the authorities, Dala left by car from the David Bernardino Paediatric Hospital in Luanda, where he worked as clinical director when he was stopped by police officers for not wearing a mask.
The doctor was then taken to the Catotes police station, in the capital's Rocha Pinto neighbourhood, when he showed signs of fatigue and began to faint, having had a bad fall, which caused minor injuries to the head, the official police statement said.
It also states that Dala died while officers were taking him to hospital.
The Union of Doctors contests this version.
The organizations president, Adriano Manuel, told Voice of America (VOA) that there are contradictions in the authorities explanations which suggest that the doctor was subjected to physical abuse.
Manuel told Deutsche Welle (DW) that the cause of death described by the police is not the real one.
Anyone who is a doctor and has studied medicine knows that this is not what killed Silvio.
According to DW, a source from the Ministry of the Interior said that the autopsy, carried out in the presence of the family and a prosecutor, concluded that the doctor was not the victim of an assault.
The union said it will take legal action against the police.
Meanwhile, the Angolan government announced the creation of a commission with the Ministry of Health to investigate the incident.
The protesters also did not believe the police's version of Dala's death.
Signs used at the protests in Luanda, in different parts of the city, said: No more killings, You are paid to protect, you are not paid to kill, I am Silvio Dala, They killed Silvio Dala.
There were also calls for the Minister of the Interior Eugénio Laborinho to resign.
The demonstrations were organized by the Union of Doctors and by various civil society collectives and organizations.

Since the beginning of the pandemic in Angola, several cases of police violence have been reported during checks on compliance with restrictive measures, sometimes resulting in citizens deaths.
Speaking to Lusa, the rapper Brigadeiro 10 Pacotes, whose real name is Bruno Santos, called for Lugarinho's resignation as well as better police training schools to improve their conduct.
The police is an organization that must give citizens confidence, today we live in serious insecurity where all citizens are afraid when they come across the police, he said.

Many took to Facebook and WhatsApp to protest the incident.
Activist and academic Nuno Álvaro Dala wrote on Facebook:
THE NATIONAL POLICE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF THE DOCTOR SILVIO DALA
The images are powerful and very clear.
We must all demand that justice be done.
The National Police must pay for the crime they have committed.
Things must not continue like this.
On Twitter, Isabel dos Santos, former chairperson of the board of directors (PCA) of the state oil company Sonangol, and daughter of former president José Eduardo dos Santos, said:
#EuSouSilvioDala sábado anunciada manifestação pacífica e silenciosa pelo Sindicato Nacional dos Médicos de Angola (SINMEA),convidando todos profissionais de saúde,outros sindicatos e sociedade civil, contra a violência policial em memória de Sílvio Dala, 12:30hLargo da Mutamba pic.twitter.com/blRs117IdY

Meanwhile, Alejandro, also on Twitter, questioned the participation of Angolan online influencers in this case:

Hachalu Hundessa interview with OMN via Firaabeek Entertainment / CC BY 3.0.
Editors note: This is a two-part analysis on Hachalu Hundessa, a popular Oromo musician whose murder incited ethnoreligious violence fueled by disinformation online.
Read Part II here.
Iconic Ethiopian singer Hachalu Hundessa gained prominence for using his creative talent to raise the consciousness of the Oromo people.
He was assassinated in a suburb of Ethiopias capital, Addis Ababa, on June 29.
That night, at 9:30 pm, as Hachalu was exiting his vehicle, a man named Tilahun Yami allegedly walked up to his car and fired a gun into the artists chest.
He was rushed to the nearest hospital, where he was officially declared dead.
It was later determined that the bullet severely damaged his internal organs.
Addis Ababas police chief reported two suspects were arrested.
After a few days, government authorities charged an alleged assassin along with two other accomplices.
In the wake of his murder, the country has struggled to come to terms with the violence that followed.
The truth of Hachalu's assassination is not yet fully clear, and in its aftermath, speculation began to fly as politicians and activists stoked long-standing tensions between Oromo and Amahara elites, two of Ethiopia's largest ethnic groups.
That day, mourners flooded the streets of Addis Ababa and cities and towns across Oromia state.
The next morning, Oromia Media Network (OMN), a satellite TV station on which Hachalu had his last contentious interview, provided online and TV coverage as his casket was transferred from Addis Ababa to Hachalus hometown, Ambo.
The slow, televised journey turned into a deadly battle between government authorities and opposition politicians over where Hachalu would be buried, and OMN interrupted its coverage as the hearse was forced to return to Addis Ababa.
At least ten people were killed and several were injured in Addis Ababa.
The scuffle led to the arrest of several opposition politicians including Jawar Mohammed, an OMN figurehead, and opposition politician Bekele Gerba, who were both charged with instigating the mayhem.
Confusion swirled after government authorities eventually took Halachu's body back to Ambo by helicopter, where feuding parties continued to clash, denying the bereaved family members a proper burial.
Meanwhile, turmoil and violence ensued.
A three-day rampage gripped parts of Oromia and Addis Ababa, at a substantial cost: 239 people were left dead; hundreds of others were injured and more than 7,000 people were arrested for violence and property damage worth millions of Ethiopian birr.
On June 30, the government imposed an internet shutdown to attempt to halt calls for violence circulating on social media that lasted three weeks.
A number of people were shot and killed by government security forces, but several news outlets including Voice of America and Addis Standard reported that angry mobs from the Oromo ethnic group attacked multiethnic, interfaith towns and cities in southeastern Oromia, targeting non-Oromo, non-Muslim families in the region.
Most of the violence fell along ethnic Amahara-Oromo lines, but religion may have played a more central role due to an intricate, localized understanding of ethnicity: The southeast Oromo communitys ethnic identity markers usually combine the religion of Islam and the Afan-Oromo language.
A local farmer reportedly said we thought Hachalu was Oromo after he watched Hachalu's televised funeral rites that followed the traditions of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
According to reports, most victims of the most gruesome violence were minority Christian Amharas, Christian Oromos and Gurage people.
Eyewitnesses say mobs destroyed and burned property, committed lynching and beheadings and dismembered victims.
A fateful interview
When news of Hachalus assassination first hit, Oromo diaspora media outlets zeroed in on Hachalus fateful interview with OMN host Guyo Wariyo, that aired the week before Halachu was killed.
During the interview, Guyo repeatedly asked Hachalu provocative questions about his alleged sympathy for the ruling party, interrupting him multiple times to challenge his answers.
Hachalu fiercely denied any sympathies with the ruling party, but also decried the deeply discordant and fractionalized Oromo political parties, demonstrating his staunch independence as a thinker and musician  a quality that made him a target for online abuse until the day of his murder.
At one point, however, Guyo asked Hachalu about the historical injustices allegedly committed against the Oromo people by Menelik II, Ethiopias 19th-century emperor who shaped modern Ethiopia.
Hachalu shocked some listeners when he answered that the horse seen immortalized in Meneliks equestrian statue in Addis Ababa belongs to an Oromo farmer called Sida Debelle, and that Menelik robbed that horse.
This exchange attracted applause  and criticism  from commentators on Facebook and Twitter.
When Hachalu was killed one week later, many members of the Oromo diaspora community immediately speculated that Hachalus criticism of the Menelik II statue infuriated sympathizers of imperial Ethiopia, which may have led to his murder.
On social media, Oromo netizens focused obsessively on Hachalus Menelik-related remarks, which led many down a winding path to an insidious disinformation campaign.
The rest of the interview contains other loaded issues of divisions and contradictions within the Oromo community.
Throughout the interview, Guyo grilled Hachalu about the countrys ongoing political reforms, stoking anti-government sentiment with questions about Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, himself an Oromo, and whether or not the government had met the demands of the Oromo people after the prime minister came to power in 2018.
Hachalu reiterated his non-involvement in the rabid partisanship of Oromo politics but he did criticize those who question Abiys Oromo identity.
He defended his position against top Oromo opposition leaders who sought an alliance with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a once-dominant party with historic ties to the now-defunct Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Front (the EPRDF).
The TPLF turned into an opposition party after Abiy dismantled the EPRDF.
Hachalu also addressed the political violence in the Oromia region, blaming both government authorities and the militant, splinter right-wing Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) militia group (informally known as OLF-Shane).
Following Hachalus murder, the government was able to acquire and release the full 71-minute interview to the public.
The missing tape included Hachalus accounts of death threats he received from parts of western Oromia, where the radical OLF-Shane militia is active.
Hachalu said he believed he would not have been attacked on social media if he had praised OLF-Shane.
He addressed a direct conflict he had with Getachew Assefa, Ethiopias security and intelligence chief during the TPLF period.
Guyo, who promoted this interview on Facebook as must-see TV in the days before its broadcast, has since been arrested and the government is investigating the full 71-minutes of interview tape for further clues that may help determine the facts regarding Hachalu's murder.

Screenshot from a Guardian YouTube video about female genital mutilation.
COVID-19 has deeply affected womens rights in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), from increased domestic violence to job loss.
But there is also one less visible area where women are affected: female genital mutilation (FGM), due to disruption in prevention because of the pandemic.
In April, the United Nations announced that due to pandemic-related disruptions in prevention programs, two million FGM cases could occur over the next decade that would otherwise have been averted.
Female genital mutilation includes all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
The practice, rooted in extensive traditions, cultural and religious beliefs throughout Africa, the Middle East and Asia, is typically performed by traditional midwives or healers using knives, razors or glass.
FGM, also known as genital cutting, is widely considered as one of the most extreme manifestations of violence against girls and women, and yet it is widely underreported in the Middle East.
It is estimated that it affects at least 200 million women worldwide.
The issue is explained in this UNICEF video:
In the MENA region, Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is a problem that primarily concerns Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, Iraq and Djibouti.
Carlos Javier Aguilar, Regional Adviser Child Protection, explains more.
Somalia has the highest prevalence of FGM with an estimated 98 percent of females between 15 and 49 years who experienced genital cutting.
In Djibouti, an estimated 93 percent are affected, Egypt, 91 percent, Sudan, 88 percent, Mauritania, 69 percent, Yemen,19 percent and Iraq, 7 percent, according to the latest figures released in June by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
The practice varies according to social class, ethnicity and education in each country, with notable differences between urban and rural areas.
FGM more often occurs among the poorest, least educated families in rural areas.
In Yemen, FGM is concentrated in coastal regions but less common in the north.
In Iraq, the practice is more prevalent in northern Kurdish provinces.
In Egypt, it is markedly higher among girls living in upper Egypt.
In Mauritania, more than 90 percent of women from the poorest families have endured FGM compared to 37 percent of women from the richest families.
FGM: An underreported violation
The scale and scope of FGM may be underestimated because the official global picture of FGM/C is incomplete, according to a joint report from March, authored by Equality Now, End FGM European Network and the US End FGM/C Network.
The report revealed growing evidence that the ritual is also practiced in other regions including the Middle East and Asia, and the world woefully underestimates FGM.
Small sample researches have recently shown that FGM is also practiced in Iran, along with Gulf states such as Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, and Saudi Arabia.
Divya Srinivasan from Equality Now told Reuters that she was particularly surprised at the results of small studies from places like Saudi Arabia and Oman, which are not normally countries that come to mind when you think of FGM.
The report, published during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Middle East, was not picked up by the Arabic speaking media or translated into Arabic, with little coverage of FGM in Arabic at all.
This lack of public awareness may perpetuate the perception that FGM is not an issue of concern.
Social taboos
In the Middle East, taboos around womens bodies and sexuality prevent open, public discussions about sensitive issues like FGM, often tied to cultural, religious and traditional beliefs.
In Egypt, for example, Christians and Muslims both believe that circumcision of girls prevents them from vice and makes them more attractive for future husbands; mothers fear that their daughters cant get married if they have not been cut, according to a report by Stop FGM Middle East, a campaign created in 2013 to raise awareness about FGM and whose aim is to get the message out that FGM exists not only in Africa, but also in many countries in the Middle East and Asia.
The organization lobbies for more data on FGM and has created a survey toolkit to help individuals and groups create small-scale surveys on FGM.
Unless there is a critical incident that makes headlines, such as the recent FGM-related death of a 12-year-old girl in southern Egypt in February, people tend to avoid the topic.
Ghida Hussein, an Egyptian student researching FGM, told Global Voices:
As we dont talk about it, it is as if the problem doesnt exist.
FGM is often practiced silently behind closed doors.
It is happening far from the more educated urban centers of power where activists and politicians are seated.
FGM is a controversial sensitive issue and unless there is international attention and funding, it is not seen locally as a priority by an overwhelming male political class.
Breaking the taboo and speaking out about FGM can expose human rights defenders and victims to hate speech and backlash.
In Oman, Women's rights activist Habiba al Hinai, founder of the Omani Association for Human Rights (OAHR), conducted a survey in Oman in 2017 and found that 78 percent of women have been cut.
After publishing her findings online, Habiba received attacks and threats:
I posted my results online and the response was huge.
I was attacked by religious conservatives who say female circumcision is a form of Islamic worship.
In Oman, where FGM is not officially recognized, there is no protection or support for victims.
Habiba added in the report:
How can you ask a survivor to speak out against FGM and then face all the consequences criticism and online defamation, her family and her tribe may disown her, maybe her husband will divorce her  without proper support.
I dont expect these women to speak out and face society.
FGM eradication: Too slow, too inadequate
In Yemen and the United Arab Emirates, FGM is only banned in medical facilities, but not in homes.
In Mauritania, there are legal restrictions, but not an outright ban.
In Iraq, FGM is outlawed in the Kurdish Autonomous Region but is still legal in central Iraq.
There have, however, been some major breakthroughs to eradicate FGM.
Following years of advocacy from womens rights organizations, Egypt banned the practice in 2008.
Sudan, in a political transition after 30 years of dictatorship, is the latest to outlaw FGM in April.
But law enforcement remains a major challenge because FGM still has a high degree of acceptance and prevalence.
Although laws are an important deterrent, they are not enough.
States need national, comprehensible strategies that include input from police, judiciary, clerics, health care providers and education to civil society.
A series of regional crises and authoritarian rule has delayed reforms, limiting campaigns and resources to tackle womens rights violations.
Now, with the world's attention shifted to COVID-19 and its economic impact, many programs that advocate for womens rights and provide social services to vulnerable women are postponed or no longer a priority.
With more families falling below the poverty line and girls taken out of school or forced into early marriage, FGM is also likely to continue to take place without notice in the region.

Abubakar Idris Dadiyata, image used with permission from The SignalNg.
Abubakar Idris Dadiyata, a lecturer and fierce critic of the Nigerian government, was abducted from his home on August 1, 2019,  in the Barnawa neighbourhood of Kaduna, in northwestern Nigeria.
One year after his abduction, Dadiyata has not been found.
Abubakar Idris (Didiyata) was abducted from his home in Kaduna state, Nigeria.
His whereabouts still not known.
His family and friends are demanding answer to the question: where is @dadiyata?
Abubakar is a victim of enforced disappearance.
Dadiyata taught at Federal University Dutsinma, Katsina State.
As a member of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, Dadiyata often sparred with members of the ruling All Progressive Congress party on social media.

Both the state and federal agencies are busy doing nothing
Dadiyata was forcefully taken by abductors at about 1 a.m. as he arrived at his home, a year ago on August 1, 2019, Premium Times reported.
Kadija, Dadiyatas wife recalls in an interview with BBC that her husband was making a phone call, his car was still running, when he was seized by his abductors.
Although Kadija could not hear what ensued over the phone or who he was talking to, she recalled that her husband's abductors had followed him, they even came into the house.
Dadiyatas wife watched from her room as they drove her husband away.
Sadly, theres still no information about Dadiyatas whereabouts.
It is painful, Kadija told the BBC, as their children keep asking about their missing father.
Rather than finding Dadiyata, Nigerian security agencies are absolving themselves from any form of guilt or blame for his disappearance.
Nigerias Department of State Security (DSS) had in January denied having Dadiyata in their custody.
The state security agency stated that since Dadiyata was taken away from his house by some armed men does not suggest that those men were DSS staff.
Similarly, Aisha Dikko, the attorney general of Kaduna State, denied knowing the whereabouts or of being involved whatsoever in Dadiyatas abduction.
Anything to the contrary is a vile assertion that seeks to stretch the fact that he was abducted within Kaduna State to mean the involvement of the state government, said Dikko.
However, these denials by DSS and Kaduna State Government neither mitigates the agony of Dadiyatas wife and their two children  nor does it restore his liberty.
The plea for Dadiyatas release still echoes on Twitter in this hashtag #OneYearWithOutDadiyata, as Nigerians demand his release.
Bulama Bukarti lamented about the trauma that this kind of impunity has caused Dadiyata's family:
Its unfathomable how a Nigerian would disappear just like that.
We must continue to do everything we can to get Dadiyata reunited with his family.
There must be no place for this kind of impunity.
Those that abducted Dadiyata will pay the price.
If not now, definitely later.
This Twitter user was shattered on hearing Dadiyata's wife interview:
I was shattered to hear Dadiyatas wife speak to @bbchausa, this morning.
All she is demanding is for his holders to forgive him and let him come back to his family; especially his little children.
Akin Akíntáyọ cannot understand how Dadiyata can disappear without a trace for a year:
One question, how can Dadiyata and his car disappear without trace for a year in Nigeria and the government be just so nonchalant about it, seeking exculpation rather than taking full responsibility for finding him, especially when they were a target of his criticism?
Unfortunately, it seems as if nobody cares about finding the critic.
Rather both the state and federal agencies are busy avoiding blame and doing nothing states human rights activist Professor Chidi Odinkalu in an interview with Vyral Africa:
Besides saying that they dont know where he is.Nobody has really made the effort to tell us what they have done to find him and how it is that they cant account for him.
It tells you how so little we matter as citizens.
The least we can do is ask where Dadiyata is and why cant our government find him.

School children in Kaduna State, Nigeria.

Armed bandits attacked a secondary school in Kaduna, northwestern Nigeria, on August 24, killing one person and kidnapping four students and a teacher, reports Nigerian online medium, SaharaReporters.
The gunmen who arrived at Damba-Kasaya village in Chikun Local Government Area, Kaduna State, at around 7:45 a.m. on motorbikes first raided the community, where they reportedly killed Benjamin Auta, a farmer, according to Nigerian online newspaper Premium Times.
The gunmen then proceeded to Prince Academy Secondary School, where they abducted teacher Christianah Madugu, and four students: Favour Danjuma, 9, Miracle Danjuma, 13, Happy Odoji, 14, and Ezra Bako, 15.
Happys father, Isiaka Odoji,  told Daily Trust, a Nigerian daily, that the gunmen are asking for a ransom of 20 million naira (about $53,000 USD) to set their children free  an amount they cannot possibly afford.
The kidnapped students in the last year of junior secondary school were writing their final examinations.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, only students in exit classes were allowed to come back to school.
Both the federal and Kaduna state governments have remained silent on the fate of the abducted students and their teacher.
Its a normal day in Nigeria
Twitter user Ndi Kato called the incident devastating for the nation:
Today in Kaduna state, children in exit classes who were told to resume school were kidnapped by armed gunmen.
One was reportedly killed.Small boy, his life cut short.The others have been taken away and we may never hear of them again.
This should devastate any nation
But it is still a normal day in Nigeria piqued Twitter user Chima Chigozie:
Some school children were kidnapped in kaduna, one of the school boys was killed along the line.
The boys life was cut short, the school children are being held in fear.This should spike the nation but NO, it's a normal day in Nigeria.
Jaja blames politics for the absence of public empathy and outrage for the kidnapped school children:
The abducted Kaduna Boys will not get the same support and attention as the Chibok Girls because firstly, they are boys, and secondly, GEJ isn't President.
Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (GEJ) was Nigeria's president when, in April 2014, 276 schoolgirls from a government secondary school were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants from the northeastern town of Chibok.
This lead to the global hashtag movement #BringBackOurGirls that resonated with millions of people around the world.

On February 19, 2018, Boko Haram also kidnapped 110 schoolgirls from Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, northeastern Nigeria.

The kidnapping of the Damba-Kasaya school children and their teacher is a grisly deja vu.
The only difference is that this time around, those responsible for this horrendous incident are not Boko Haram  but armed bandits.
The rampaging bandits of Kaduna
Banditry violence spiked in Nigerias northwestern states of Zamfara, Kaduna, Niger, Sokoto, Kebbi and Katsina.
ACAPS, an independent humanitarian think tank, asserts that this armed violence is unconnected to the Boko Haram insurgency in the northeast:
The banditry violence began as a farmer/herder conflict in 2011 and intensified between 2017 to 2018 to include cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, sexual violence and killings.
By March 2020, more than 210,000 people have been internally displaced.
Rural communities have been left at the mercy of these bandits who, between January and June this year, have killed at least 1,126 people in northern Nigeria.
Villages in southern Kaduna are the worst hit, with 366 lives lost in the first half of 2020, says Amnesty International.
Chikun LGA, the home of the kidnapped students, had experienced a series of militia attacks that has resulted in the deaths, abduction, with 45 communities displaced and occupied since 2019, according to the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union.
The people of southern Kaduna allege that the bandits are Fulani herders, on a land grab mission, with the passive consent of both the federal and state governments.
But Kaduna State governor, Nasir El-Rufai denied that the carnage had anything to do with land grabbing nor any ethnoreligious motivation.
On August 22, the Kaduna State government relaxed the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., which was imposed in some parts of the state to curb the banditry.
Nonetheless, Luka Binniyat, spokesman of the Southern Kaduna Peoples Union (SOKAPU) laments that hunger is also killing us because we cannot go to our farms.Our people are helpless.

Poet Henry Swapon and lawyer Imtiaz Mahmood.
Collage from photos shared widely on social media.
Two people were arrested on May 14 and 15, for comments they had posted on Facebook.
The arrests have sparked indignation and concern on social media.
The arrest of poet Henry Swapon
On May 14, poet and journalist Henry Swapon was arrested at his home in Barishal city, located in south central Bangladesh.
He has been accused of violating Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.
A member of the small local Christian community, Swapon was previously sued, along with two brothers Alfred and Jewel Sarkar, for hurting religious sentiments of both Christians and Muslims on social media.

According to the Dhaka Tribune, Swapon wrote a post on Facebook criticizing Lawrence Subrata Howlader, the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Barishal.
The Bishop had elected to hold a scheduled cultural program at a local Catholic church on April 22, 2019, the day after the terror attacks in Sri Lanka.
Swapon felt the Bishop should have postponed the festivities out of respect for hundreds of people killed in the attacks.
Other Christians were angry about the tone he took with the Bishop and some even sent him death threats.
Swapon has been vocal in social media against all the injustices and corruption in his town.
Netizen Swakrito Noman wrote on Facebook:
In Bangladesh, the tactics of attacking activists with the allegation of hurting religious sentiments had been a monopoly of the Muslim fundamentalists.
Now we see that conservative Christians are also at it.
I think those who feel this way hearing criticism are mentally sick.
The state should arrange treatment for these sick individuals.
We strongly condemn the arrest of poet Henry Swapon and demand his unconditional release.
The arrest of lawyer Imtiaz Mahmood
On the morning of 15 May, police arrested supreme court lawyer and writer Imtiaz Mahmud in a case filed in 2017 under the country's now-defunct Information and Communication Technology Act, in which a private citizen, Shafiqul Islam, alleged that one of Mahmood's Facebook posts had hurt religious sentiments and incited communal violence in Bangladesh's southeastern Chittagong region.
Imtiaz Mahmood secured an anticipatory bail when the case was originally brought, but a Khagrachhari court issued another arrest warrant against him in January 2019.
Mahmood had commented on ethnic tensions that arose after a Bengali motorcyclist was killed in Khagrachhari, prompting a group of Bengalis to torch a number of houses and shops of the indigenous people in the Rangamati area of Chittagong.

Many netizens have expressed condemnation against both arrests, with some demanding that the law should be repealed.

Absolutely shameful.
The Bangladesh government cannot ensure public safety but prompt to arrest people under the repressive Digital Security Act which is, by the way, against the very spirit of the constitution of Bangladesh.

Despite concerns about its implications for freedom of expression, the Bangladeshi parliament approved the Digital Security Act in September 2018.
The law replaced the notorious Information and  Technology Act, which had also been used as a tool for silencing critical speech online.
The Act criminalizes various types of online speech, ranging from defamatory messages to speech that injures religious values or sentiments introducing hefty fines.
It also authorizes lengthy prison sentences for using the internet to create public unrest, and for gathering, sending or preserving classified government documents using a digital device.
The Editors Council of Bangladesh said that the Act is against the freedom guaranteed by the constitution, media freedom and freedom of speech.

The Act also provides absolute power to law enforcement agencies to initiate investigations of anyone whose activities are deemed harmful or threating.

In the aftermath of the Sudanese revolution, transitional authorities of Sudan have signed a peace agreement with The Sudan Revolutionary Front  the main rebel group still active after former leader Omar al-Bashir was deposed last year.
The historic peace agreement, signed on August 31, in the city of Juba, South Sudan, found regional and international support from Troika countries, the European Union, Egypt and several Gulf countries.
But this exciting moment is also overshadowed by a period of historic flooding that has devastated parts of Sudan, causing a downward spiral in an already stressed economy.
Still, Sudanese citizens on social media also welcomed the news.
Waleed Ahmed, a Sudanese blogger, wrote:
Today we give back, we return home.

Yesterday's signing will put Sudan in a new momentum, on the parties, the Sudanese people, parties and civil society, in cooperation with friends and the regional neighbourhood.
We must create a solid platform for a new history for our country.
Sudans Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok welcomed the peace agreement, saying:
I dedicate the peace that we signed today in the brotherly State of South Sudan, to our children who were born in displacement and asylum camps, to mothers and fathers who long for their villages and cities, waiting for the glorious December revolution, the promise of return, the promise of justice, the promise of development, and the promise of safety.
The agreement guaranteed autonomy for rebel groups in their controlled areas under the supervision of the federal government.
It will guarantee one-third of parliament chairs for people from rebel areas in order to reflect their needs and issues.
The agreement will guarantee justice and equality for those who were persecuted by the former regime, often for being non-Muslim and non-Arab.
This is not the first peace agreement in Sudan history.
Some netizens say that peace agreements are routine in Sudan, and may not bring peace and stability.

Incomplete agreement
Despite this exciting moment, two main rebel groups did not sign the agreement: The SLMA), led by Abdul Wahid al-Nur, and Sudan Peoples Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, both refrained due to lingering questions about the mechanisms for integrating armies and the country identity.
Three days after the peace signing, Sudan PM Abdalla Hamdok traveled to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to meet with al-Hilu to discuss points of contention, according to Sudan Tribune.
Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok on Wednesday held a secret meeting with Abdel Aziz al-Hilu in an effort to break the deadlock in the peace talks mediated by the South Sudanese government.https://t.co/IrNxxW9a0M pic.twitter.com/VgtyDZxfv3
The meeting resulted in the signing of a joint agreement of memorandum reinforcing the principles of the peace talks in Juba.
Sudan social media buzzed with a circulated copy of the agreement in English, with a particular focus on Article 3 on the subject of religion and state:
A democratic state must be established in Sudan.
For Sudan to become a democratic country where the rights of all citizens are enshrined, the constitution should be based on the principle of separation of religion and state in the absence of which the right to self-determination must be respected.
Freedom of belief and worship and religious practice shall be guaranteed in full to all Sudanese citizens.
The state shall not establish an official religion.No citizen shall be discriminated against based on their religion.
Sudanese people split into two camps on the matter: The first sees the separation of religion and state as a guarantee of fundamental human rights; the second says the transitional government does not have the right to decide this without authorization from citizens via democratic elections.
Following the meeting, the prime ministers Twitter account published an Arabic version of the agreement that differed from the English one, addressed as a joint press release.
While the English document emphasized the separation of religion from the state as an inevitability, the Arabic document only recommended discussion of the controversial issue.
The differences between the two documents raise questions about the future of this agreement.
Historic peace, historic floods
While peace has brought happy news to Sudan, the Nile River continues to flood, ushering in an unprecedented humanitarian disaster.
According to a Sudanese National Council for Civil Defense report on September 8, total losses due to the Nile flood amounted to 103 deaths, 50 injuries, 5,482 deaths of livestock, 27,341 complete house collapses, 42,210 cases of partial house collapse, damage to 179 government and private facilities, loss of 359 shops and stores and damage to 4,208 agricultural acres.

On September 3, Sinnar state governor Ustaz Elmahi Sulieman issued a distress call on Facebook:
The levels of the Blue Nile this night witnessed a great rise accompanied by heavy rain, which led to the breaking of the covers and shields, a simple dam built by sacks of the soil, of the city of Singa and Umm Benin areas, and the water began to flood the city and its homes, as well as the neighbourhoods of Umm Benin.
Therefore, we launch a directive to all official bodies and an appeal to all civil authorities and organizations to come to the rescue of the citizens as soon as possible, and to provide shelter, medicines and food.
The situation is catastrophic:
Sinnar state | Singa city The situation is catastrophic after the rain broke out the city's water shield, which allowed the waters of the Blue Nile to enter the city.
Sudanese youth from Tuti Island have built a shield to prevent floodwaters from reaching the islands interior.
It was a heroic scene, described by Hassan Shaggag:
These are the ones who will build Sudan  and not the ones who are fighting for power now.
Sudanese citizens lack basic necessities like bread, gas, medicine and electricity  with power outages up to six hours a day.
The Sudanese pounds inflation rate has exceeded 202 percent, according to Professor Steve Hanke.
Yet, transitional authorities have not been able to gain control over the market.
Now that theres again the promise of peace, what are the governments plans to make life easier for citizens?

Student leader Jutatip Sirikhan covered herself in white paint in a symbolic act of protest following her release.
Photo and caption from Prachatai
This article is from Prachatai, an independent news site in Thailand, edited and republished by Global Voices as part of a content-sharing agreement.
Student Union of Thailand (SUT) president Jutatip Sirikhan has been arrested while on the way to university on September 1 for her participation in the July 18 mass protest.
Jutatip was arrested while in a taxi on her way to class at Thammasat Universitys Tha Prachan campus in Bangkok.
She went live on Facebook at 12:50 pm on September 1 when plainclothes police officers stopped the taxi she was in and delivered an arrest warrant.
Jutatip was taken to Samranrat Police Station.
An officer accompanied her in another taxi to the station, since she did not feel safe enough to travel in the private car the officers brought to arrest her.
She stayed live on Facebook and read out passages from the Thai translation of Thomas Paines Common Sense during the travel to the station.
She was then taken to the Bangkok Criminal Court and was granted bail and released at 5:20 pm in the custody of a lecturer at Thammasat University.
The Court did not require her to immediately pay the 100,000 baht (3,190 US dollars) bail but imposed the condition that she does not repeat the actions for which she was being charged  the same condition given to everyone else who has been arrested and released on the same charges.
Jutatip is the 14th activist to be arrested for participating in the July 18 mass protest.
Fifteen other participants at the protest have also received a summons and reported to Samranrat Police Station to hear the charges against them on August 28.
Jutatip was charged with sedition and violation of the Emergency Decree and the Communicable Diseases Act, among other charges.
Jutatip appeared in front of the Criminal Court after her release and gave a short press conference.
Paint can be washed out, but we cant wash out injustice
I didnt intend to run away to begin with.
I know I have an arrest warrant.
I have been waiting to be arrested for a very long time, but it didnt happen until today.
Each time someone gets arrested, there will be slurs against our side that we did not protest peacefully.
I am a student and I have been harassed by the police for months, for years.
Why is there no compensation for me?
Why must there be compensation for the police who are servants of the dictatorship?
There should actually be a summons first, but what happened was that the police brought the arrest warrant and arrested me.
Its extremely unfair to a student.
They followed me with my phone signal, followed me from where Im staying.
They threatened my home, they threatened my family, they took a warrant to my house, so now we have to escalate our protest.
Everything is supported by the Constitution.
We pay our taxes.We must receive protection from the state, not harassment from the state.
So today I have to express myself symbolically that we can do this.
We must stand by our rights and freedoms.
Throwing paint is also something that can be done.
Jutatip then threw a bucket of white paint over herself while holding up her hand in the three-finger Hunger Games salute.
She said that the white paint represents purity and justice, and that they are demanding justice back.
We are showing that this is freedom, this is the kind of expression we can do.
Even if now it is throwing paint over ourselves, it is a way of showing that we can throw paint at any time.
We can throw paint over those with power, because those with power throw legal charges over us, throw bullets at us without exception.
Paint can be washed out, but we cant wash out injustice.
Afterward, Jutatip thanked the lecturer who came to make bail for her and the people who came to support her and helped the crowd clean the paint off the sidewalk in front of the footpath in front of the Court.
We wont stop fighting until we win in everything, including monarchy reform and a new constitution, Jutatip said.

This post was written by Grace Jolliffe and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation based in India.
A slightly edited version is published below as part of a content-sharing agreement.
While India is going through a major general election spread over seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 in order to elect its 17th parliament (Lok Sabha), some Indian voters have taken the unusual step of boycotting the electoral process.
Read More: All you need to know about India's 2019 general elections
In Goa, a southwestern state of India, residents of a tribal hamlet in Canacona block (district subdivision), Marlem Village refused to vote on 23 April during the third phase of the general election, alleging that the government had been oblivious to the problems of their village.
Their main grievance is that basic facilities, such as proper roads and water supply, have not been provided by the government.
A video by Community Correspondent Devidas Gaonkar, a member of the aboriginal shepherd tribe of Goa called Velip, documented the protests of the villagers:
In this video, Pandurang Gaonkar, a resident from Marli village, states that:
Tirwal to Marlem is a three-quilometres road stretch, which is incomplete.
To date, no action has been taken by the authorities.
They only make false promises, but no implementation.
For this reason, we havent cast our votes.
The residents of Marlem have been living in this village for more than 20 years.
In 1968, the Forest Department declared Marlem village part of a wildlife sanctuary.
This makes the construction of roads, or any development work in this area, a rather complex issue.
According to reports, an underground power cabling project for carrying electricity to the area had been initially approved, but when digging work commenced, it was soon halted following objections coming from the state Forest Department.
Another source of frustration for the local population is the absence of proper roads.
One has to navigate a 2.8 km unpaved and broken road to reach the first household at Marlem from the main road.
Finally, the supply of electricity and safe drinking water remain a challenge for the villagers.
Having publicly and repeatedly voiced their complaints, but failing to get any answers, the residents of Marlem, as well as residents from two other villages decided not to vote in the elections in order to draw the attention of the authorities towards their issues.
Polling officials came to talk to us, but our decision of not to vote, still stands, added Pandurang.
Isidore Fernandes, an opposition (Indian National Congress) member of the legislative assembly of Cancona, also met the locals.
After hearing the grievances he assured his support in favour of their agitation.
It is important for any government to provide road, water, and electricity to people.
Till now, all government officials have neglected these facilities in Marlem Village, stated Fernandes.
Boycotting elections is now becoming a way of protest, although voting is not mandatory in India.
Apart from Goa, villages in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, the western state of  Maharashtra, and the eastern state of Odisha are employing this method in order to get pressing issues addressed by the authorities in charge.
So far, none of those boycotts seem to have translated into action on the side of government.
Ultimately, voters are adopting such tactics as a show of frustration towards officials and politicians who often reach out to neglected communities only before elections, in hope of securing their votes, but fail to deliver once the elections are over.
In the end, if boycotting elections does not heed changes in society, what else can members of neglected communities do to get the attention of those supposed to hear them and take proper action?

The journalist Amade Abubacar.

Journalists Amade Abubacar and Germano Adriano, who were detained earlier this year while covering the military conflict in northern Mozambique, were released pending trial on 23 April, 2019.
Amade, who contributes to various local media outlets including Zitamar News and A Carta, was detained on 5 January while he interviewed internally displaced people in the Macomia district of Cabo Delgado, a northern province of the country.
Germano, a reporter for the local community radio Nacedje, disappeared on 6 February and was found to have been detained on 18 February.
According to the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA), Amade and Germano were charged with spreading defamatory messages against members of the Mozambican Armed Defence Forces via a Facebook account that announced attacks which occurred in villages in the district of Macomia.
The journalists were released from the provincial jail of Mieze in Pemba, Cabo Delgados capital, and will be on probation as they await trial before the provincial judicial court of Cabo Delgado.
Their first hearing is scheduled for 17 May.
Since 2017, groups armed with knives have carried out attacks on villages in Cabo Delgado, burning houses and decapitating residents.
More than 90 people have died since the attacks began, according to the police.
To date, no group has publicly claimed responsibility for the attacks.
In December 2018, the newspaper A Carta de Moçambique revealed the existence of a Facebook page, run under a name that appears to have been falsified, that praised the armed groups attacks in Cabo Delgado.
It unknown whether or not the accusations against Amade and Germano are concerning this same page.
The journalists defence team says there is no connection between them and any illegal activity via Facebook.
The proceedings against the journalists have been marked by irregularities.
After detaining Amade, the police placed him in military custody.
He was put in a military prison, where he spent 12 days incommunicado before being transferred to a civilian prison.
The journalists were only charged on 16 April, violating the deadline of 90 days set out in the Mozambican Law of Pre-trial Detention in the case of Abubacar.
In court proceedings during their pre-trial detention, both journalists were accused of crimes of violating state secrets through digital means and public incitement to a crime using digital means.
These accusations differ from the formal charges that have now been filed against them, which MISA described as spreading defamatory messages against members of the Mozambican Armed Defence Forces via a Facebook account that announced attacks which occurred in villages in the district of Macomia.
During the 106 days he spent in prison, Abubacar faced a lack of food and refusal of medical assistance, according to Amnesty International.
His family told the newspaper @Verdade that they were stopped from visiting him during the whole time that Abubacar was in custody.
What has happened to these journalists may be part of a trend of intimidation against media workers in northern Mozambique.
Independent investigative journalist Estácio Valoi was detained in December 2018, also in Cabo Delgado on legally dubious terms.
He was later released, without any charge, but his work equipment remains in the armys custody.
Calls for justice
Cídia Chissungo, an activist and organiser of the #FreeAmade campaign, celebrated the news:
#AmadeAbubacar and #GeramanoAdriano are finally FREE after almost 4 months detained.
Ofcourse we have to celebrate but we won't forget how everything started.
We said a long time ago:Journalism is not a crime
Thanks for your hands#FreeAmade #CaboDelgado #HandsForJustice pic.twitter.com/Lhb0b1ALCi
Angela Quintal, coordinator of the Africa Program for the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), commented:
Now to ensure charges are actually dropped and that #AmadeAbubacar can continue with his journalism without fear of reprisal.
The fact that he had to endure detention without trial for 106 days before getting bail is unconscionable.
He should not be facing trial at all!

Global Voices co-founder Ethan Zuckerman defines bridge figures as people who are passionate about explaining their home cultures to people from other societies.
The concept was developed through the deep roots it has in Global Voices, and defines much of the work and ethos of the community.
Since our Iran coverage aims to bridge the divide that exists between external perspectives on Iran and the actual country itself, Global Voices Iran has started a series of interviews with various Iranian journalists and writers who practice this role.
These interviews are done to understand how and why these figures, who make a career out of communicating the intricacies and complexities of a country riddled with contradictions, explain Iran to non-Iranians.
Golnaz Esfandiari: I think the use of social media in Iran and its significance is increasing
Golnaz Esfandiari is a senior correspondent at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and one of the few journalists based outside of Iran writing in English about the nuances and intricacies of Iranian society and politics.

In an interview with Global Voices, she said:
I think the use of social media in Iran and its significance is increasing.
Government officials admit that and I also see more people inside the country using social media sites and apps.
I actually think that since 2009, the use of social media has increased considerably.
Some Iranians told me they joined Twitter after reading about the allegations about a Twitter Revolution in Iran.
Social networking sites have facilitated conversation and the sharing of content that is banned or considered sensitive, people can discuss taboo subjects relatively openly.
They also challenge state policies and stances on social media quite regularly.
Kelly Golnoush Niknejad: You have to be a journalist, but a psychiatrist, professor, and mind reader as well
Iranian media entrepreneur Kelly Golnoush Niknejad is the founder of Tehran Bureau, a news agency hosted by The Guardian that covers Iran and the Iranian diaspora.
Her project is one of the leading sources of coverage that gives a dynamic view of the countrys culture, politics, and people.

Read more: How Kelly Golnoush Niknejads Tehran Bureau Bridges Iran and the West
On misconceptions that non-Iranians have about Iran, she explained:
When it comes to Iran, I often find myself having to go all the way back to 1979, then explaining the transformations that took place decade-by-decade, just to make sense of the present.
Its sometimes even hard for Iranians themselves to believe what goes on in Iran, let alone non-Iranians.
This explains why its vital to cover Iran from the bottom up, chronicling the lives of ordinary people.
Covering a country by reporting on the pronouncements of the ruling elite is probably the least interesting or informative kind of journalism.
Thats why even very sophisticated people who follow the news on Iran have no idea what goes on there.
Of course if they followed Tehran Bureau though, they would get a very dynamic view.
Nina Ansary: I believe women will be at the forefront of any change in Iran
Nina Ansary is the author of Jewels of Allah: The Untold Story of Women in Iran, the first book to cover the leading feminist political movements from the end of the 19th century to the present.
Jewels of Allah cover
The book explains how women have shaped Irans recent history, and continue to do so, while working to establish their rights and equality in a society that has traditionally marginalized them.
Read more: Talking to Iranian Feminist Author Nina Ansary on the Eve of Change in Iran
Ansary said she was cautiously optimistic about the future of Iran and the place of women in it:
only because I see their resilience.
And this is because female activism has yielded partial results: women were not allowed to serve as judges, but can now serve as investigative judges.
Women werent allowed to enter certain fields of study, and over the years they have been able to penetrate into male dominated areas such as medicine and engineering.
I'm cautiously optimistic, but I believe women will be at the forefront of any change in Iran.
Saeed Kamali Dehghan: They see Iran as black and white, and Iran is not like that.
Its a spectrum, its a rainbow.
With over 800 Iran-related bylines to his name, Saeed Kamali Dehghan is the first staff journalist at The Guardian dedicated to covering Iran, and one of the few Iranian nationals employed by a major English-language media institution.

Much of his reporting relates to Irans human rights violations, but as he said in a phone interview, the common problem in many western media organisations is that they see Iran as black and white, and Iran is not like that.
Its a spectrum, its a rainbow.
Read more: Saeed Kamali Dehghan on Covering Iran for The Guardian
On the difficulties of covering a country he has an emotional attachment for, Saeed explains:
As an Iranian I have an emotional attachment to the country, but when Im writing news I step back and try to be impartial.
But Im allowed to express my opinion when I write op-eds, and Ive also done that sort of thing.
I wrote about why Canada is getting it wrong on Iran, which led to the then Canadian foreign minister accusing me on Twitter of working for the Iranian authorities.
Ive been attacked by some people who accuse me of working for the Iranians and by others who accuse me of working for the Brits.
I hope thats a sign Im doing my job right!
Omid Memarian: To turn that explosive anger into something constructive, to put it into perspective and not take it personally, is an art.

Omid Memarian was formerly a widely read journalist inside Iran, and now works in the United States covering Iranian news for both English and Persian speaking audiences.

Memarian describes his experience writing and reporting on civil society as a journalist in Iran:
There were, and still are, people in Iran who believe that by empowering civil society organizations, political parties and independent media, the Islamic Republic might change gradually from within.
On the other side, there are forces trying to prove them wrong, and one way to do so is by making the environment so threatening that no one dare stay active in the field.
When I insisted on continuing to what I was doing, writing and promoting the things I believed in, I was arrested and thrown into jail.
Hooman Majd: Iran is not uniquely paradoxical: what's unique is that most people dont know about Iran.
We are now at a turning point in US foreign policy.
Weeks away from the end of the Obama presidency, there is a strong possibility that the US is moving away from the defining project of rapprochement with its long-time foe, the Islamic Republic of Iran.
At the dawn of the Donald Trump presidency, which is slated to be a peculiar shade of hardline and hawkish Republicanism, I thought it a timely moment to sit down with journalist and author Hooman Majd.
His books, articles and commentary explaining the paradoxes of Iran became widely featured in the American mainstream media during the Bush era, when hawkish rhetoric against the Iranian government became a hallmark of the early 2000s foreign policy and media depictions of Iran.
Hooman Majd has been known to be the voice of Iran to the western world.

On whether misconceptions on Iran have lessoned since his 2008 book that aimed to dispel misconceptions about Iranian society to American audiences:
Ahmadinejad was the first to make himself available to the media, which is the source of a lot of the negativity.
But Iranian-Americans and Iranian-Europeans have written a lot about the culture in the recent years, and there's a lot more travel between Iran and the US, among both Iranian-Americans and Iranians themselves.
They are understanding it a little bit better and there have been a number of books.
Iran is not uniquely paradoxical: what's unique is that most people dont know about Iran.

Protesters in Rio de Janeiro: Our weapon is education | Image: Marianna Cartaxo / Mídia NINJA/Used with permission
On May 15, thousands of Brazilians took to the streets in all 26 states and the Federal District against the Bolsonaro government's slashing of federal funds to education that will affect dozens of universities and schools.
At the end of April, Brazil's government announced cuts of 30 percent on a so-called discretionary budget, which goes towards expenses such as electricity, water, general maintenance, and research.
When considering the total federal budget for higher education, the cuts would amount to around 3,5 percent.
Besides, the government has suspended funds for 3,500 publicly-funded postgraduate scholarships.
From Paulista Avenue in São Paulo, a traditional gathering spot for protests, to far away indigenous lands in Alto Rio Negro, near the border with Colombia, people went out to defend their public education.
In Viçosa, Minas Gerais, a crowd of around 5,000 people marched with umbrellas under heavy rain.

https://globalvoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/WhatsApp-Video-2019-05-15-at-21.00.30.mp4
Brazil has 69 federal universities and a large number of state universities, all offering undergraduate and postgraduate education completely free of tuition, and several community-oriented services such as extension courses, legal assistance offices, and hospitals.
Initially, the cuts would apply to only three federal universities, but they were later extended to the entire federal network.
Bolsonaro's Education Minister Abraham Weintraub says that they're not cuts but a contingency of expenses.
Weintraub has justified the cuts because public universities are places of mayhem.
When asked by reporters to name examples of such mayhem, he mentioned the presence of social movements in campuses, and parties with naked people.
Weintraub was appointed as minister in early April after his short-lived predecessor's administration became involved in a series of controversies.
The new minister often voices rightwing conspiracy theories, such as that crack cocaine was introduced in Brazil as part of a communist plot, and that he wants to erase cultural Marxism from universities.
Some university deans have said that the cuts might impede them from opening their doors as early as the second semester of 2019.
The Federal Prosecutor's Office has sent a report to the attorney general claiming the cuts violate Brazil's Constitution.
Rio de Janeiro you look BEAUTIFUL!
Hundreds of thousands are occupying Avenida Presidente Vargas as night falls to protest the budget cuts to science and education.#15M #TodosPelaEducação #TsunamidaEducação #NaRuaPelaEducação pic.twitter.com/8MIn91crKX
Researchers at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) who study WhatsApp groups in Brazil have detected conversations around universities on that messaging app in the days following the budget cut's announcement.
The study has developed a tool that monitors WhatsApp groups and is widely used by fact-checking agencies in Brazil.
Lead researcher Fabrício Benevuto said on a Facebook post on May 8:
[The images include] monographies/dissertation/events mocked by their titles and topics.
There are images of naked people in parties (that aren't even in universities) and protests and memes that say university students take 12 years to graduate because they're on drugs all the time.
It's clearly an orchestrated effort.A professional's job.
It's the same style of the electoral campaign.
Who finances this factory of disinformation?
An article by website Ciência na Rua (science in the streets in Portuguese) claims that public universities produce 95 percent of scientific research in Brazil.
A study by the United States consultancy Clarivate Analytics in 2018 points out that on the top 20 universities with the most prominent research production, 15 are part of the federal network.
On the day of the protests, Minister Weintraub was summoned to testify about the budget cuts in the lower house of Congress.
Bolsonaro is the enemy of Education
Education is an act of Love and Courage#TsunamiDaEducacao pic.twitter.com/sEEOb5wDxz
Meanwhile, Bolsonaro was in Texas, in the United States, where he met former US president George W. Bush.
When asked about the protests, the president said:
Its natural [that protests happen], now, the majority of people there are militants with nothing inside their heads.
If you ask the result of 7 times 8, they wont know.
If you ask about the composition of water, they wont know, they know nothing.
They are useful idiots, imbeciles, and are being manipulated by a canny minority that commands many federal universities in Brazil.

Online harassment has become a new form of censorship.
Women journalists carry the double burden of gender-based abuse online in addition to potential threats related to political reporting.
These ongoing threats have led women journos to withdraw from public discourse  leaving the journalism profession dominated by men.

In November 2016, Ugandan journalist Joy Doreen Biira, who was working at the privately-owned Kenya Television Network (KTN) in Kenya, returned home to Uganda for a traditional ceremony.
While Biira was home, Ugandan security forces clashed with members of the traditional Rwenzururu kingdom in the Rwenzori region of western Uganda, and their palace was burned to the ground.
The gunbattle resulted in 62 deaths, including 16 policemen.
Biira reacted to the military raid by posting her thoughts on Facebook on November 27:
Its so sad what Ive witnessed today with my own eyes  part of the palace of the kingdom Im from, the Rwenzururu Kingdom, burning down.
It felt like watching your heritage deplete before my eyes.
That same day, Biira was arrested and accused of circulating graphic photos of the aftermath of a deadly battle between security forces and the regional kings royal guard of the Rwenzururu kingdom  to a widely subscribed WhatsApp group, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
She also posted an Instagram video of the king's palace burning and wrote about it on Facebook, CPJ reported.
Uganda security officers allegedly forced Biira to delete social media posts and her digital tools were also confiscated,  according to a 2018 Freedom House report.
Biira was charged with abetting terrorism for illegal filming of a military raid on a regional kings palace  an act punishable by death under the Anti-Terrorism Act if convicted.
However, a day later, she was released on bail.
Biiras ordeal sparked condemnation on social media through hashtags such as #FreeJoyDoreen and #JournalismIsNotaCrime.
This netizen criticized Ugandan President Yoweri Musevenis tendency to silence journalists:
#FreeJoyDoreen President @KagutaMuseveni should stop silencing journalists.
That is total impunity in our continent pic.twitter.com/SGUX985cM0
Biiras lawyer, Nicholas Opiyo, posted a tweet of Biiras official charges:
Copy of Joy's police bond  charged with abetting terrorism (ridiculous!)
#journalism is not terrorism @KTNKenya @KTNKenya #FreeJoyDoreen pic.twitter.com/g5v7cgGryn
Opiyo told Global Voices that Biiras case was dropped and closed in March 2017 after authorities investigated it and found no evidence to charge her in a court of law.
Like many such cases, one is reviewed to be free but left with a sense of unfairness, injustice, and pain, said Opiyo, who is also the executive director of Chapter Four Uganda, a human rights organization.
Opiyo added that spending a few days in jail and enduring the pain of being locked up never leaves you.
Targeted online attacks
Women journalists who experience abuse online rarely see justice and often struggle to have their complaints taken seriously and properly investigated.
In April 2017, Gertrude Tumusiime Uwitware, a news anchor at NTV Uganda, defended Stella Nyanzi, an outspoken professor who criticized the Museveni administration for failing to fulfill a campaign promise to distribute sanitary pads to poor girls.
Authorities forced Uwitware to delete her Twitter and Facebook posts with comments in support of Nyanzi.
She received threats on Facebook and was then abducted by unknown assailants for at least eight hours, according to a 2017 Uganda human rights report.
Her kidnappers allegedly interrogated her about her connection with Nyanzi, badly bit her and cut her hair.

Ugandan feminist Stella Nyanzi's court battle continues
Uwitware was later found at a police station in Kampala.
However, authorities have not released any updates on the investigation into her kidnapping.
Political journalists  especially those who cover opposition politics  often experience threats more than any other kind of journalism.
But women journalists have it worse because the government believes they are weaker and easily intimidated, according to Mukose Arnold Anthony, Secretary for Media Safety and Human Rights of the Uganda Journalists Association (UJA), who spoke to Global Voices via WhatsApp on April 3.
When it comes to sexual harassment online, female journalists fear to open upalthough a few  disclose  the majority end up dying silently, Anthony said.
Women journalists may face extra psychological harm, breach of privacy, loss of identity, limitation of mobility, censorship, and loss of property as a result of their work, according to a UNESCO study on freedom of expression in Africa published in 2018.
And, according to a Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda 2018 study, 12 percent of women journalists have suffered abuses and violations, including death threats and arrests.
Three-quarters of women journalists suffered violations at the hands of state agents such as the police, resident district commissioners and other security operatives.
Attacks and harassment
Ugandan journalist Bahati Remmy has faced attacks and harassment on the job as a female reporter.

Bahati Remmy, a Ugandan female journalist who now works in the United States, told Global Voices that she quit reporting news in Uganda because she felt jaded after her horrific ordeal while covering the elections in Uganda in 2016.
Ugandan police arrested Remmy while doing a live broadcast for the privately-owned NBS TV to cover the house arrest of opposition politician Dr. Kizza Besigye in the town of Kasangati.
Remmy told Global Voices:
The police engaged in a running battle not to allow any journalists to cover the story concerning Besigye.
Police fondled her breasts in the police van, undressed her at the station and exposed her naked body to a camera, according to Remmy.
She was also followed and harassed by a police officer on Facebook because the Ugandan government thought she had connived with Besigye to taint the countrys image.
She told Global Voices that anonymous notes left at her door threatened to kidnap her if she refused to reveal Besigyes exit route from his house.
In the aftermath of Remmys arrest, Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda took a poll to gauge public opinion about the ordeal.
They asked: Uganda police claimed that NBS TV reporter Bahati Remmy disobeyed lawful orders and also obstructed police officers on duty hence her arrest?
Do you agree?
Magambo Emmanuel wrote:
It is a lame excuse and total lie because there is video footage that shows how Bahati was arrested.
Police should stop shifting their problems to innocent journalists.
Davide Lubuurwa wrote:
Whoever tries to let the people know how the state is standing is to be arrested.
A very big problem is coming to Uganda soon.
What bothers me most is that whoever tries to say something that is not in support of the current regime is taken to be a rebel so the Ugandan people must wake up.
Many women journalists in Uganda have stopped reporting stories that are critical of the government because they fear attacks and harassment by the state.
Media practitioners have said that government and security agents occasionally call editors and instruct them to not to publish stories that negatively portray the government.
These attacks often go unreported  especially for women  which has also made it difficult to understand the full scope of this problem.
Remmy dragged the Ugandan government to the Uganda Human Rights Commission, but until today, there has been no update on her case.
The commission lacks the required independence to rule in favor of those who submit complaints against the government.
Its seven members, including its chairperson, are appointed by the president, with the parliaments approval.
They are biased, Remmy said, adding: They have a huge backlog and most of the cases they want to hear are cases brought in by the government.
Many threats faced by women journalists online are closely linked to abuse offline.
Remmy believes that the right, plight and dignity of female journalists should be upheld at all times because attacks on women silence the media as a whole.
As Uganda plans to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in 2021, attacks and harassment of women journalists by the state need to stop because it affects access to information, freedom of expression and democracy rights of Ugandan citizens.
Press freedom remains an undermined child in the countrys system, Remmy told Global Voices.

Tree roots cling to a 15th-century wall on Kilwa Kisiwani Island, Tanzania.
In 1981, the ruins of the powerful Swahili sultanate on the island were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Editors note: This personal essay was written following a Twitter campaign organized by Global Voices sub-Saharan Africa and Rising Voices where each week, a different language activist shared their perspectives on the intersection of digital rights and African Languages  as part of the project, The identity matrix: Platform regulation of online threats to expression in Africa.
According to the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), linguistic and cultural diversity are of strategic importance for people around the world to strengthen the unity and cohesion of societies.
This linguistic and cultural diversity propelled the UNESCO general conference to proclaim International Mother Language Day (IMLD) in November 1999, to be commemorated annually on February 21 annually.
To bolster IMLD, the United Nations (UN) declared the International Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL 2019), to draw attention to the endangerment of the worlds indigenous languages.
Today, there are over 7,100 languages spoken around the world, 28 percent of which are spoken on the African continent alone.
Despite this, English dominates online spaces in the region.
Some twenty years ago, 80 percent of the worlds online content was English-centric.
Currently, however, English content online is said to have shrunk to between 51- 55 percent.
The million-dollar question, therefore, is: Could this sharp drop be an indicator that people now favor their native languages online over English, considering that less than 15 percent of the world population speaks English as their first language?
Swahili: Coming to birth?
Swahili is recognized as one of the official languages of the African Union (AU), alongside English, Portuguese, French, Spanish and Arabic.
Swahili is also the lingua franca for East Africa Community (EAC) member states.
Rwanda, an EAC member, saw its lower legislative house approve a law making Swahili an official language in 2017  in addition to Kinyarwanda, French and English.
Besides being used for administrative purposes, Swahili will be incorporated into Rwandas school curriculum.
In Uganda, the government in September 2019 approved the establishment of the National Swahili Council.
Article 6 (2) of the Constitution of Uganda also spells out that Swahili shall be the second official language in Uganda to be used in such circumstances as Parliament may by law prescribe.
In 2018, South Africa, which boasts 11 official languages, formalized Swahili as an optional subject in its curriculum, starting in 2020.
In 2019, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) adopted Swahili as its fourth official language.
Swahili invisibility online

Despite Swahili being the most widely spoken African language, with approximately 150 million speakers  mostly in East Africa, the Great Lakes region, southern Somalia, and some parts of Southern Africa, its visibility online is dismal.
John Walubengo, a lecturer at the Multimedia University of Kenya, states in an op-ed with the Nation, a Kenyan daily, that the absence of online linguistic and cultural diversity creates a society with a tunnel-vision view of the world.
Walubengo predicts that most indigenous cultures end up surrendering their identities to the English way of doing things.
This sad reality can only be reversed if indigenous civilizations fight to retain their identities both online and offline, he says.
But all is not gloom and doom.
There are some dedicated organizations at the forefront of promoting and developing Swahili online.
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
(ICANN), a global multi-stakeholder organization that coordinates Internet Domain Name System (DNS), Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and autonomous system numbers, instituted the Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) that enable people to use domain names in local languages and scripts.
Ideally, they are formed using characters from different scripts, such as Arabic, Chinese, or Cyrillic.These are then encoded by the Unicode standard and used as allowed by relevant IDN protocols, a set of standards defined by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), and its subsidiary groups; the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF).
The Universal Acceptance Steering Group (UASG)
UASG is a community-based team of industry leaders, supported by ICANN, that prepares online communities for the next billion internet users.
This is achieved through a process known as Universal Acceptance (UA) that ensures that internet applications and systems treat all top-level domains (TLDs) and emails based on those domains in a consistent manner  including those in non-Latin-based languages and those that are more than three characters long.
UA serves digital natives around the world in their local languages and with domain names that better align with their cultural identities.
Hence, promoting a multilingual Internet.
ICANNWiki
This nonprofit organization provides community-developed wiki on ICANN and Internet Governance, has over time partnered with organizations, educational institutions and individuals in Kenya and Tanzania.
This has enabled East Africans to build, translate and add Wiki resources in their own vision, language and perspective.
This Swahili initiative  that I have personally been part of  has immensely bridged the information gap on Internet Governance issues by localizing ICANNWiki content to promote local engagement in the target communities.
Localization Lab
Localization Lab is a global community of volunteer collaborators who support the translation and localization of digital safety tutorials and tools like TOR, Signal, OONI, Psiphon.
These technologies address security, privacy and anonymity online by ensuring that indigineous language activists have safe spaces for accessing information online.
Localization Lab has translated more than 60 of these safety tools into over 180 different languages and dialects from around the world, among them Swahili.
Kondoa Community Network (KCN)
KCN is the first community network to pilot the use of television white space (TVWS), a wireless technology that employs unused parts of the radio spectrum in the 470 to 790 MHz frequency band  to address internet connectivity in rural Tanzania.
KCN trains the rural populace to create and host local content thats befitting to their context.
Matogoro Jabhera, KCN founder and lecturer at the University of Dodoma, Tanzania, told Global Voices in a Skype call, that he believes that local content provides an incentive for more [of the] offline population to get online because they can relate with their local news [] compared to the current situation where most contents are in the English language.
The next billion multilingual users on the internet
The world anticipates connecting the next billion users of the internet and 17 million of these users are projected to get connected online using language as their digital identity.
Therefore, a lack of sufficient local content could have adverse effects as far as digital inclusion.
This will outrightly affect digital rights  largely, internet access, right to access information online, and the right to use their own indigenous language to create, share and disseminate information and knowledge through the internet.
It is thus vital to put in place formidable action plans that will foster the development of ICT applications and services, as well as the use of local languages, to guarantee digital inclusion for all.
This, complemented by actions such as localization of digital training and learning materials, and rural ICT literacy programs, is likely to spur a digital revolution, hence promoting digital rights of internet users and bridging the digital divide.
Ultimately, this process will hasten the protection, respect and promotion of  all African and minority languages on the internet as enunciated in the principles of the African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedom.

Building on Writing Toward Freedom: Politics and digital rights in Africa, this five-week social media outreach initiative will involve a curated dialogue on @GVSSAfrica featuring five African language activists who will focus on the intersection of language and digital rights.
Identity Matrix is funded by the Africa Digital Rights Fund of The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA).
Global Voices is part of the grantees for the African Digital Rights Fund.
The activists will tweet in African languages like Bambara, Igbo, Khoekhoe, N|uu, Swahili, Yorùbá, in addition to French and English.
They will also share their personal experiences and insights using a language lens on challenges and threats to digital rights.
The conversations will interrogate how threats to net neutrality marginalize digital content in African languages; the expansion of mis- and disinformation in African languages on various digital platforms and what companies or civil society are doing about it; the effects of a lack of affordable internet connectivity in places where there are large communities of speakers of an African language; the importance of and challenges for the right to access information in digital spaces in African languages.
They will also look at corporate policies, as well as ongoing challenges that may affect how citizens can freely express themselves in their language.

Protesters demand the removal of then-President Robert Mugabe (now deceased) from power on November 18, 2017.

In the early morning of November 15, 2017, Zimbabweans woke up to the news that former strongman, the late Robert Mugabe, had been deposed in a coup d'etat, and was under house arrest with his family at the presidential residence, State House.
Major General Sibusiso Moyo, now foreign affairs minister, announced on state television that the president was safe under state custody and that the situation has moved to another level.
Almost immediately following General Moyos announcement, Zimbabweans fervently took to social media  in particular, WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook  to get updates on the situation.
This newfound popularity of social media to access information and mobilise protests took root for the first time among Zimbabweans, when protesters took to the streets and helped push Mugabe out of office.
The new government, led by Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, took notice of social medias power.
As a former state security minister, Mnangagwa also appreciated the importance and value of disinformation in Zimbabwes political terrain.
In a calculated move to consolidate newfound political power and ensure an electoral victory during the presidential and legislative elections scheduled for next year, Mnangagwa instructed his ruling ZANU PF (Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front) party youth league to enter the social media and online firmament and batter the opponent, back in March 2018.
In post-Mugabe Zimbabwe, this has exacerbated a mis- and disinformation crisis, leaving Zimbabweans with few credible and accurate sources of information to stay informed about the countrys transition and and anti-government protests.
While the new government decried fake news pertaining to any news circulated on social media that they perceived to threaten the countrys status quo, it also deployed tactics aimed at misleading the public about its handling of anti-government protests.
The bane of online free expression
Zimbabwe has witnessed a significant rise in mobile internet and social media usage over the past few years.
The internet penetration rate increased by 41.1 percent, from 11 percent of the population to 52.1 percent between 2010 and 2018, while mobile phone penetration increased by 43.8 percent from 58.8 percent to 102.7 percent over the same period.
This means that half the population is now connected to the internet, compared to only 11 percent in 2010.
However, mis- and disinformation have found fertile ground to flourish owing to a variety of factors: extreme polarisation in the media, proposed government controls over social media, poor official communication methods and low digital literacy among internet users.
During the anti-government protests of January 2019, when state security forces arrested and beat hundreds of protesters, news of these clampdowns competed with government claims of fake news or their absolute denial.
The government restricted access to internet services to disrupt the flow of information and contribute to widespread confusion.
They and their supporters also resorted to public misinformation about the protests and discredited any truthful information or reports as fake news.
In Zimbabwe, citizens usually regard general statements issued by government ministers as official policy.
For example, Deputy Information Minister Energy Mutodi sought to convince people that everything was normal and that videos and images of the military patrolling the streets were the work of a few rogue individuals.
Mutodi further misled the nation when he claimed on state television that there was no internet shutdown but rather a congested network.
In another suspected case of possible government-sanctioned disinformation, millions of people remained cut off from social media during the January protests.
Others downloaded Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications to stay informed, but messages circulated that downloading such applications would lead to arrests, creating further panic and apprehension.
When in March 2019, Human Rights Watch (HRW) tweeted a report denouncing the governments use of horrific violence during the January 2019 protests, government supporters took to Twitter to discredit and attack HRW.
One user tweeted that the organization is spreading blatant lies and described HRW as neo-colonial organization hired to malign innocent countries to push the US's hegemonic goals.
Another repeated government claims and blamed the violence on rogue elements who are trying [sic] destroy the image of the president.
And disinformation about government policies and other events of public interest have continued well beyond the January protests.
Most recently, ruling party ZANU PF members took to Twitter to misinform the public about the disappearance of Dr. Peter Magombey, acting president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association (ZHDA).
He was abducted on September 14, 2019, following the announcement of a strike in the health sector.
The ZANU PF secretary for youth affairs described Magombey as a buffoon and an embarrassment to the profession.
An account under the name of ZANU PF Patriots said that his abduction was fake.
Others disseminated false claims that doctors killed many patients because of the strike, including more than 500 people in one hospital.
Zimbabwes historic conundrum
Media control in Zimbabwe bears its origins in colonial policies of the 20th century, which were tainted with violent subjugation to political authority.
The Ian Smith-led Rhodesian government valued propaganda and centralised information control as a weapon of choice, not only to endorse the regimes believed legitimacy but to spread disinformation about the war.
The colonial government passed a plethora of laws to suppress free expression or dissent against Smiths racist policies and they brutally enforced these laws to target liberation leaders.
Information blockades were the norm even before independence in 1980, and this set the government's tone in terms of communication policies and media management for years to come.
As renowned South African journalist and writer, the late Heidi Holland, wrote in her acclaimed biography, Dinner with Mugabe: The Untold Story of a Freedom Fighter Who Became a Tyrant:
So many in ZANU PF's hierarchy have lived with similar appalling violence woven into everyday life as if it were normal.
The bush war, or Second Chimurenga, has never really ended in Zimbabwe.
Today, Mnangagwa continues this legacy, suppressing voices of critics through online disinformation tactics and internet shutdowns.

In Uganda, the internet has become a battleground where the government attempts to silence a growing online population voicing dissent.
For years, Ugandan authorities have deployed different tactics to stifle political dissent and keep the ruling National Resistance Movement party and President Yoweri Museveni in power.
This includes blocking media websites, filtering SMS and shutting down social media platforms.
As Ugandas 2021 general election approaches, authorities are expected to continue deploying similar tactics.
2016 election shutdowns
During the 2016 general elections, Ugandan authorities resorted to shutting down entire social media platforms twice.
The first shutdown took place on February 18, 2016, on the eve of the presidential election, and it affected social media platforms and mobile money services.
The restrictions lasted for four full days.
On May 11, 2016, social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter and mobile money transfer services were once again blocked.
This shutdown lasted for one day and took place a day before President Museveni was sworn in for his fifth term as president.
Museveni has been in power since 1986.
Opposition to his rule is growing: According to a public opinion poll released in April 2019, an overall majority of Ugandans opposed a 2017 decision to remove the maximum age limit of 75 to run for president, which would allow the 74-year-old to run again in the 2021 elections.
During both shutdowns in 2016, the Ugandan government cited national security as the motivation behind restrictions.
The disruptions were ordered by Ugandas security agencies and the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC), which regulates the telecommunications sector, online publications, broadcasting (both radio and television), film industry, postal and courier services.
On February 18, 2016, MTN Uganda, a telecommunications service provider, issued a statement on Twitter confirming that UCC, the regulator had directed MTN to disable all social media and mobile money services due to a threat to public order and safety.
This also affected other telecoms companies such as Airtel, Smile, Vodafone, and Africel.
The same day, President Museveni told journalists that he ordered the blocking of social media: Steps must be taken for security to stop so many getting in trouble, it is temporary because some people use those pathways for telling lies, he said.
On March 17, in an official declaration during Supreme Court deliberations in which President Musevenis 2016 victory was challenged, the UCC executive director Godfrey Mutabazi explained that he received instructions from the Inspector General of Police, Kale Kayihura, to shut down social media networking sites and mobile money facilities owing to security concerns.
These shutdowns interfered with the rights and daily lives of Ugandans who use the internet and social media platforms to access information, express views and conduct everyday business online.
During the weeks prior to the 2016 elections, Ugandans actively tweeted and debated about the elections using hashtags like #UgandaDecides and #UGDebate16.
Ugandan citizens level of online civic engagement was sparked by the first-ever televised presidential debates, the first of which was held in January and the second, a week later.
Even with the social media bans in place, many Ugandans continued to post about the elections using Virtual Private Networks or VPNs.
On election day, citizens were able to share updates on late arrivals of voting materials at various stations, reports of election malpractice, and provisional election results on social media.
Human rights activists say that targeted shutdowns during election periods slow down communication, just when access to information and citizen expression are most needed.
Internet shutdowns limit people from communicating particular concerns that affect them, such as health, interaction with friends as well sharing of political views and opinions, Moses Owiny, the chief executive of the Center for Multilateral Affairs, an independent platform for policy analysis operating in Uganda and Tanzania, told Global Voices in an interview.
According to Owiny, shutdowns primarily aim to stop dissent in politics based on perceived fear by the state that citizens views and concerns are likely to incite the public, an accusation he believes is unfounded and not grounded in reality but assumptions.
Ugandas history of blocking platforms and websites
On April 14, 2011, the UCC instructed ISPs to temporarily block access to Facebook and Twitter for 24 hours to eliminate connecting and sharing information.
The order came in the heat of opposition-led walk to work protests over rising fuel and food prices.
The regulator stated that security agencies requested the block to minimize social media use in order to prevent violence.
In 2011, the elections were marked with SMS filtration that contained certain words including Egypt, bullet and people power.
In the lead up to the 2006 elections, the UCC instructed ISPs to block access to the website of Radio Katwe for publishing malicious and false information against the ruling National Resistance Movement and its presidential candidate, according to a 2015 ICT policy briefing by Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA).
Ugandan authorities blocked access to the radio station and the Daily Monitor website for publishing independently tallied election results.
Media platforms were quickly reinstated but only after the electoral commission announced official results.

According to Human Rights Watch, in 2018 authorities targeted six opposition members including Bobi Wine and Francis Zaake, ahead of the August 15 by-elections in Arua (northern Uganda).
Members of the police and military arrested the group along with 28 other people on August 13, 2018, and charged them with treason.
They were later released on bail.
That same day, police also arrested two journalists, Herber Zziwa and Ronald Muwanga, as they covered the by-election and related violence, including the deadly shooting by the military of Bobi Wines driver.

As the 2021 election approaches, Uganda authorities are very likely to continue to crack down on political dissent, including through social media shutdowns.
In fact, since the 2016 elections, there has been no change in the legal framework that allows the government to restrict the rights to freedom of expression and access to information online.
According to the 2016 State of Internet Freedom in Africa report,  the 2013 Communications Act gives UCC broad powers and functions under Section 5 that permits the communications regulator to monitor, inspect, license, supervise, control, and regulate communications services and to set standards, monitor, and enforce compliance relating to content.
At the request of the government, the UCC used this section to order ISPs to block access to social media and mobile money services during the 2016 elections.
The government continues to weaponize these laws to control public debate and to silence political dissent, particularly at times of elections.
Owiny argues that the state is capable of shutting down the internet at any time deemed necessary: Where regime security and that of its citizens converges, and where regime security is threatened, the regime security and its survival will take precedent.
Nongovernmental organizations and human rights defenders have been organizing in Uganda so that shutdowns like the ones that took place in 2016 dont happen again.
Several organizations wrote a joint letter to the African Union and regional bodies asking them to condemn the decision by Ugandan authorities to shut down internet access during the 2016 elections.
Unwanted Witness Uganda took the Ugandan state to court, along with internet service providers and the regulator, in a case filed in September 2016.
The organization contended that the internet shutdown planned by the state violated the rights of Ugandans to personal freedom of speech and expression is enshrined in Article 29(1) of the 1995 constitution.
However, a judge ruled that the applicants failed to prove any violations that resulted from the shutdowns, Unwanted Witness Uganda told Global Voices.
Achieving uninterrupted access to the internet  particularly during the upcoming elections  will require more advocacy.
Owiny suggested the need for digital rights activists to deepen conversations between the government and private sector to present the negative impact of shutdowns because the private sector is intimidated by the state.
Uganda was among the first African countries to enact a right to information law, known as the Access to Information Act (ATIA), in 2005.
The law promises to provide efficient, effective, transparent and accountable that will enable the public to effectively access and participate in decisions that affect them as citizens of the country.
Will the government meet its mandate to promote the right to access to information?
Will it live up to its promise?
This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights through methods such as network shutdowns and disinformation during key political events in seven African countries: Algeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.
The project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights Fund of The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA).

Thousands of visitors to the historic city of Stone Town, Zanzibar, have followed the sound of music to the Dhow Countries Music Academy (DCMA), a music school that promotes and preserves the islands musical traditions of the Swahili Coast along the Indian Ocean.
Since 2002, the school has promoted and preserved the Zanzibar's unique mix of Arab, Indian and African cultures through music.
After 17 years, the school faces a financial crisis that threatens its closure.
Nearly 70% of its 80 full-time students can't afford to pay their tuition, which comes to about $13 USD per month, according to an official DCMA press release.
While the school has received support over the years from international donors and diplomatic missions, they face a gap in funding that may force them to shut their doors at the historic Old Customs House.
Without crucial funds to continue, DCMA students and staff fear that the soulful sounds that flow through the hallways of this iconic institution that make these islands sing  may cease.
The school not only teaches and promotes traditional culture and heritage through music, but it's also home to a community of young musicians who seek alternatives to making a living as creatives.
A DCMA student learns the qanun, a featured instrument in classical taarab songs.

We [have started] to face a very challenging financial moment, said Alessia Lombardo, managing director of the DCMA, in an official DCMA video.
From now to the next six months, we are not sure that we can guarantee the salaries to our teachers and staff.
At the moment, 19 master teachers and small core staff have gone without salaries for over three months as the school struggles to secure strong funding partnerships and explore sustainable funding models for a school.
While the archipelago is known as a tourist destination for its pristine beaches and luxury hotels, the majority of local people struggle with high unemployment even as poverty has slightly decreased, according to The World Bank.
For 17 years, the DCMA has worked tirelessly to promote and protect Zanzibars rich heritage and traditions through music.

Kidude, Zanzibar is home to musical genres that emerged through cultural exchange and collaboration along the Swahili Coast for hundreds of years.
Today, students can learn traditional musical genres like taarab, ngoma and kidumbak, along with instruments like drums, qanun and oud, as gatekeepers  and interpreters  of culture and tradition.
Neema Surri, a violin player at the DCMA, has been studying the violin since the age of 9.
I know many young people who would like to study music but they cant afford the minimal tuition fee because they are poor and unemployed, Surri said in the DCMA video.

After completing DCMA workshops, certificate and diploma courses, many DCMA students go on to perform on world stages as award-winning bands and solo artists.
Zanzibars Amina Omar Juma, a former DCMA student and current DCMA teacher, recently returned from a tour in South Africa with her critically acclaimed, Siti and the Band, known for fusing the roots by blending traditional taarab sounds with contemporary, layered rhythms.
She and other band members, also former DCMA students, released their first full album, Fusing the Roots, in 2018, going on to perform at Sauti za Busara, East Africa's largest music festival, that same year.
Here's Siti and the Band's Nielewe (Understand Me) and music video, depicting scenes from Zanzibar while telling the story of a woman who experiences domestic abuse and dreams of life in music, much like Omar Juma's personal story:

A history of cultural crossroads and collaboration
Over 15,000 visitors have passed through the academys iconic building to enjoy live performances, workshops and classes and interact with passionate DCMA musicians who represent the future of Zanzibar culture and heritage, according to the DCMA.
Drawing from a complex history of Indian, Arab and African exchange, the school celebrates the influence of dhow countries, with inspiration from cultures that converged along the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf.
The Omani Sultanate, a major maritime force from the 17th to 19th centuries, shifted its seat of power from Muscat to Zanzibar in 1840.
From Stone Town, Omani kings oversaw elaborate systems of maritime trade, including cloves, gold, and textiles, powered by strong winds that set dhows  traditional Arab vessels  sailing across the Indian Ocean, from India to Oman to East Africa.
Young Zanzibaris recognize the importance of connecting with the past to determine their future and the music created today expresses that desire to bridge the old with the new.
DCMA students and teachers recently formed TaraJazz, a blend of traditional taarab and modern jazz.
Their violinist, Felician Mussa, 20, has only been studying the violin for 3.5 years; TaraJazz is one of the most sought-after bands on the islands, captured here by photographer Aline Coquelle:
The Swahili coast tells the story of epic cultural exchanges and the DCMA continues this tradition through its musical collaborations.
Every year, the school hosts an initiative called Swahili Encounters, matching well-known musicians hailing from Africa, the Middle East, Europe and North America with DCMA students to create original musical compositions within a week-long period.
At the end of the encounter, the newly-formed collaboration performs at Sauti za Busara, and many of these collaborations turn into life-time friendships that transcend the boundaries of language and culture, proving music is a universal language.
DCMA offers weekly live performances showcasing students talents and collaborations with visiting musicians, Stone Town, Zanzibar, 2019.

The DCMA recognizes that music empowers and unites people across cultures  and it also employs talented youth living in a struggling economy with limited job opportunities.
For the 1,800 students who have trained at the DCMA, this is the only musical home they know, where they can learn and grow as professional musicians and artists.
One traveler from Spain, who recently visited the DCMA, wrote on TripAdvisor: Personally, meeting the musicians was the best piece of my time on this island.
As Zanzibars tourism sector rapidly grows, the DCMA believes that music plays an essential role in the celebration, preservation and promotion of Swahili culture, heritage and history.
Zanzibar is far more than its beaches and luxury hotels  its a place bursting with talent that stems from an extraordinary history of cultural connection and collaboration.

Sierra Leone: Health workers prepare to enter an area where Ebola patients get treatment.

On August 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a positive development in the clinical trials of drugs being tested for the treatment of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR of Congo).
WHO asserted that the Ebola drugs showed advances that will bring patients a better chance of survival, and further affirmed that two out of the four drugs being tested are more effective in treating Ebola.
Who is the man behind the Ebola cure?
Esteemed professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe-Tamfum, director-general of the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB) DR of Congo, who invested a substantial part of his adult life treating the virus.
While the international media has often focused heavily on the deadly, contagious nature of Ebola in DR of Congo, less has been said about the Congolese scientist who discovered its cure.
Muyembe-Tamfum declared: We will no longer say that EVD [Ebola virus disease] is not curable.
Based on Muyembe-Tamfum's tireless work, scientists tested four drugs for Ebola treatment: ZMapp, remdesivir, mAb114 and REGN-EB3.
The results from the clinical trials conducted in 499 study participants showed that patients treated with REGN-EB3 or mAb114 had a greater chance of survival when compared to those treated with the two other drugs.
The trials were conducted under the auspices of the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB), the DR Congo Ministry of Health and three medical humanitarian organizations: the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA), the International Medical Corps (IMC) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
The Congolese scientist behind the Ebola treatment
Muyembe-Tamfum has been researching Ebola since its first known outbreak in DR of Congo in 1976 when he became the first researcher to travel to the area of the first outbreak.
Dr Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director general of the Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale in the Democratic Republic of #Congo and his team have discovered a new Ebola treatment that can cure symptoms in just an hour
A professor of microbiology at Kinshasa University Medical School in DR of Congo, he has been working for the past 40 years on a cure for the disease.
In 1995, he worked with WHO in implementing detection protocols and control measures in the first documented urban outbreak of Ebola in Kikwit, DR of Congo.

With this discovery, people infected with Ebola will now have more trust in the possibility of recovery and will be more likely to go to the hospital for treatment.
Now that 90 percent of their patients can go into the treatment center and come out completely cured, they will start believing it and building trust in the population and community.
Jean-Jacque Muyembe-Tamfum
Why Ebola treatment matters
The first recorded cases of Ebola occurred in 1976 near the Ebola River in DR of Congo.
According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), since then, the Ebola virus has emerged periodically from its natural reservoir (which remains unknown) to infect people in Africa.
Ebola virus outbreaks since 1976.
Map from the Centres of Disease Prevention and Control
Between 2014 and 2016 there were more than 28,600 recorded cases of Ebola within West Africa.
According to a WHO 2015 report:
In October 2014, Senegal had one case of Ebola infection and zero death.
WHO declared Nigeria's curtailment of the virus as a piece of world-class epidemiological detective work.
In January 2015, Mali had 8 reported cases and 6 deaths.
However, the most devastating cases occurred between March and June 2016 in three countries: Sierra Leone: over 14,000 cases and about 4,000 deaths; Liberia: about 10,000 cases and 3,000 deaths; Guinea:  3,800 cases and 2,500 deaths.
The global narrative on Ebola
Ebola's ravaging of African countries generated global panic and hysteria in 2015 when two patients died in the United States and one each in Spain and Germany.
GabyFleur Böl, a researcher at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin, Germany, identified other cases in Spain, Germany, the UK, Italy and Switzerland.
At that time, an Ebola infection was considered a death sentence due to the lack of an effective treatment.
As  Böl asserted, the high mortality rate of Ebola and also the sometimesexaggerated media coverage of the epidemic created hysteria around the world.
This position was further corroborated by a 2017 study in which Hal Roberts, Brittany Seymour, Sands Alden Fish II, Emily Robinson and Ethan Zuckerman analyzed over 109,000 stories published in US mainstream/regional media and blogs between July to November 2014, with a focus on Ebola coverage.
They discovered that three distinct peaks in Ebola coverage in the United States media and blogs occurred around July 27, September 28, and 15 October 2014:
On July 27, reports broke of the first infections of American doctors in Liberia.
On September 30, media widely reported the infection of Thomas Duncan in Texas as the first infection on US soil.
On October 12, Ebola coverage intensified with the first infection of a health care worker in the United States.
After October 12, a series of other US infection-related events led to continuous coverage that gradually lessened in intensity over time.
US media may have covered Ebola so intensively because of the presence of the disease in the US.
In addition, with a more interconnected army of digital networks, the Ebola epidemic became more amplified in Europe and the US.
However, what remains to be seen is if the discovery of a cure by an African from DR of Congo to this African epidemic will also garner as much coverage as it did in 2017.

On July 29, six plainclothes policemen forcefully removed journalist Erick Kabendera from his home in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and took him into police custody.
Police say Kabendera had failed to obey a summons to investigate the status of his Tanzanian citizenship.
Over the last week, police searched Kabenderas home twice, confiscated his passport and other personal documents and interrogated his family.
By August 5, authorities switched track, charging Kabendera with money laundering, tax evasion in the amount of $75,000 United States dollars, and criminal racketeering, according to a copy of the charge sheet obtained by the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Police say Kabendera committed these crimes over a four-year period beginning in 2015.
With these charges, Kabendera may face up to 15 years in prison and can not seek bail.
Tanzania's Magufuli
First they abduct a journalist, when there is an outcry they claim he is not Tanzanian, when that doesn't stick, he is charged with organised crime and tax evasion.
People, meet Erick Kabendera, his crime is journalism.
Press freedom has drastically deteriorated in Magufuli's Tanzania, CPJ reports.
CPJ sub-Saharan Africa Representative Muthoki Mumo says:
It seems that for the past week, authorities have been searching for a way to justify their detention of this critical freelance journalist.
First, they claimed Erick Kabenderas citizenship was in question, today they have leveled drastically different charges, which call into question their motive for holding him.
As a journalist, Kabendera has been critical of President John Magufulis administration and often speaks out in favor of press freedom.
He has reported on Tanzanias divisive politics for international and local media such as The Guardian, African Arguments and The East African.
Jebra Kambole, Kabenderas lawyer, says authorities also accused Kabendera of sedition for allegedly publishing an article titled John Magufuli is bulldozing Tanzanias freedom, in The Economist, but this charge was later dropped.
Just in: Tanzanian Journalist Erick Kabendera to be charged with sedition over an article published in the Economist titled John Magufuli is bulldozing Tanzanias Freedom.Statement from Jebra Kambole states that Mr Kabendera has been denied bail.
Citizenship targeted as tool for repression
Kabenderas family says this is not the first time the Tanzanian government has questioned Kabenderas citizenship.
In 2013, authorities lobbed a similar charge against him but the case was later dismissed, according to The Citizen.
Kabendera felt at the time that authorities called his citizenship into question as a way to silence him.
Last year, The Citizen also reported on several other cases where the government used the citizenship question as a tool to silence critics in Tanzania.
Aidan Eyakuze, executive director of Twaweza, a civil society organization focused on citizen voices, says authorities confiscated his passport and banned him from travel while investigating Eyakuzes citizenship status.
Two weeks prior, Twaweza had issued and released results from a survey called Speaking truth to power?
Citizens views on politics in Tanzania.
The Commission for Science and Technology (Costech) claimed the survey was unauthorized and threatened legal action but later dismissed the case, according to the same Citizen article.
Tanzania has in recent years introduced a series of amendments and laws that target bloggers and media, civil society organizations, arts and cultural organizations and academics and researchers in what is by critical observers perceived as attempts to control Tanzania's narrative and stifle free speech and political dissent.

Hundreds of journalists, human rights advocates and concerned leaders and citizens flooded social media in support of Kabendera:
AFEX Africa calls the charges a blatant act of violation:
It's been nine days and Tanzanian police are still holding investigative journalist, Erick Kabendera in custody.
@AFEXafrica calls for an end to this blatant act of violation: https://t.co/7UFZkzYzwV @MRA_Nigeria @FXISouthAfrica @gmpressunion #FreeErickKabendera #NoImpunity
AFEX (@AFEXafrica) August 6, 2019
Kabendera, who often mentors aspiring journalists, inspired this tweet from a former student:
I have met Erick Kabendera once in my life, and for a little less than 80 minutes.
He came as a guest Tutor to my class (School of Journalism and Mass Communication- @UniofDar).
Despite the brief time he spent with us, I learned a lot from him.
He truly inspired me!
#100K4Erick
Another netizen notes that Kabendera's arrest and trumped-up charges signal a warning to other citizens:
I don't defend Kabendera because he's a Tanzanian or because he's a journalist.I defend him because I live in Tanzania where Erick lives.
If rights are not granted to him today, and I stay silent, it's possible that tomorrow, rights will be denied to me also.
No one is safe when Injustice reigns.

I and we are (all) Ivan Golunov.
Banner provided by Meduza, used with permission
: this Russian expression meaning boiling pointthe point when enough has become enoughis perhaps the best way to convey how an increasing number of Russians feel about the arrest of Ivan Golunov.
Golunov, a leading investigative journalist, was detained on June 6 in Moscow on what appear to be trumped-up charges of drug dealing and possession.
Golunov was arrested and initially denied access to a lawyer, in violation of Russian law.
His lawyer confirmed he sustained serious injuries while in custody.
After being taken to hospital, he was discharged and placed under house arrest on June 8.
The Russian police initially produced photos of a drug lab allegedly found when they searched in Golunovs flat, but the images were later retracted.
The pro-Kremlin media outlet Russia Today also confirmed that the pictures were not taken in Golunovs flat.
The charges being leveled against Golunov could lead to a 10 to 20-year prison sentence.
Thirty-six-year-old Golunov works for Meduza, one of the few remaining independent Russian-language online media platforms.
Meduza is registered in neighboring Latvia, but maintains an office and several journalists in Moscow.
Golunov has led and published several investigations pointing at cases of corruption involving high-ranking officials.
Since Golunovs arrest, Meduza has released Golunovs articles under a Creative Commons license and has encouraged media outlets and individuals to republish the stories, an initiative fully supported by Global Voices.
Among his most important reports are ones detailing how Moscows deputy mayor Pyotr Biryukov channeled state contracts to his family, and how Moscow's urban beautification program involved inflated budgets.
The story he was working on just before his detention focused on the monopoly of funeral services in Moscow.
Golunov's arrest has sparked a rare expression of solidarity among not only journalists, activists and lawyers, but also actors, popular singers, and figures from outside the liberal circles of Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
On June 10, three leading newspapers agreed to publish editions with identical front pages in support of Golunov.
The newspapers were sold out in record time.
In a rather ironic u-turn, pro-Kremlin media, including Channel One, Russias most-viewed TV channel, are also calling for a fair investigation.
June 12 marks Russia Day, when public marches and demonstrations approved by local authorities will take place.
Under Russian law, public demonstrations require a permit.
Golunovs supporters have announced they will hold their own march without obtaining official permission.
Kremlin observers say the Russian government is seeking to lift the charges against the journalist before June 20.
On that day, President Vladimir Putin, whose ratings have fallen to a historical low in the country, will host the Direct Line, his annual talk show where he takes questions from citizens by telephone and online media.

Its been a little over 24 hours since Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina left this world, but his presence and impact continues to reverberate around the globe.
The outspoken, openly gay writer rebuked convention and challenged the status quo, triggering a literary revolution that would open the door to thousands of aspiring writers ready to change the narratives in and about Africa.
The writer, educator and LGBTQ activist, Binyavanga Wainaina, 48, passed on Tuesday, May 22, in Nairobi, Kenya, after a brief illness.
Today's got me thinking: what will your life mean when it's all over?
Binyavanga's death has got me thinking about who I was about five or so years ago, and also who he was to us as young enthusiastic Africans hungry for a different paradigm of our continent and our selves.
Fungai Machirori (@fungaijustbeing) May 22, 2019
Within minutes, Wainainas friends, followers and admirers flooded social media to swap tributes and memories while arguing which of his prolific writings had the most influence.
Wainaina is best known for his provocative essay, How to Write About Africa, published in Granta magazine in 2006.
He's also known for his 2012 memoir, One Day I Will Write About This Place, and the essay, I am a homosexual, mum, published simultaneously in Chimurenga and Africa is a Country in 2014.
The essay caused a powerful stir on Twitter as people tried to parse fact from fiction, and subsequently, Time magazine named Wainaina one of the top 100 most influential people in the world.
In How to Write About Africa, Wainaina called out Western media and the aid industry  both particularly present in Nairobi  for perpetuating negative stereotypes about the continent of Africa, through scathing satire.
Never have a picture of a well-adjusted African on the cover of your book, or in it, unless that African has won the Nobel Prize.
An AK-47, prominent ribs, naked breasts: use these.
If you must include an African, make sure you get one in Masai or Zulu or Dogon dress.
His sarcasm was dripping  a stellar scalpel, writes Nigerian writer Nwachukwu Egbunike.
Widely cited by academics, non-governmental organizations and aid workers, the essay   also published as a small booklet  has had a profound impact on perceptions of Africa and continues to circulate, surprise and provoke.
On its impact, journalist Pernille Bærendtsen writes:
For me, this essay has followed me since I received it as a gift in 2008 by a Kenyan friend.
I clearly belonged to the group of people Binyavanga addressed: A development worker employed by a Danish NGO in Tanzania writing about its impact.
This was at a point when the development and aid industry sharpened its rhetoric in favor of fundraising at the cost of unfolding the contrasting diversity on the ground.
I had plenty of reason to feel embarrassed, but I also had time to plan how to change.
Binyavanga later explained in the journal Bidoun how this essay randomly came to life with double-effect: By exposing and describing the insecurity of novelists, NGO workers, rock musicians, conservationists, students, and travel writers, who read these guidelines on how  or maybe rather how not to  write about Africa, they then began to ask for his approval.
Wainaina, a son of a Kenyan father and Ugandan mother, continued to challenge stereotypes about Africa with his groundbreaking 2012 memoir, One Day I Will Write About This Place.
Through rich, searing detail, he transported readers from his childhood in the 70s in Kenya to his student days in South Africa, where he spent many years in exile.
Critics hailed the book as raw and honest, but Wainaina later admitted that hed left out an important chapter  his love life.
With I am a homosexual, mum, Wainaina became the first high-profile Kenyan to come out as openly gay on social media, triggering an avalanche of social opinion.
Considered the lost chapter from his memoir.
Wainaina imagines coming out as gay to his dying mother.
His essay was timely as a wave of anti-gay crusades and legislation were being proposed in Uganda and later Tanzania, where homosexual acts remain criminalized.

However, unlike other writers who went into exile, Wainaina returned home, and as Nanjala Nyabola points out for BBC on Twitter, that was major:
For those of us who grew up with "the best Kenyan writers" (whatever that means) living in exile, jailed and persecuted, or poor and under appreciated, or censored heavily, he came back and that was major.
He was a complex man, but I think for this he deserves endless gratitude.
We must free our imaginations
While Binyavanga ironically attracted admiration from the diverse international crowd he criticized, at home he felt the pressure of not fitting the set frames.
Binyavanga demanded free space and imagination.
Courageously  within a growing community supportive of LGBTQ  he insisted on bending those frames.
In response to all the noise and pushback, that same year Wainaina produced We Must Free Our Imaginations, a six-part Youtube series detailing his ideas on freedom and the imagination.
I want to live a life of a free imagination, he declared in Part 1.
I want this generation of young parents to have their kids see Africans writing their own stories  that simple act is the most political act one can have.
I want to see a continent where every kind of persons imagination does not have to look for  being allowed.
I am a Pan-Africanist, I want to see this continent change.
Wainaina often channeled his desire for change through his literary activism, education and leadership.
In 2002, after winning the prestigious Caine Prize for his essay, Discovering Home, he used the award money to co-found Kwani?
a literary magazine promoting new voices and new ideas emerging from across the continent.
Kwani?
evolved over time into a publishing house and literary network that connected emerging and established writers from Lagos to Nairobi, Mogadishu to Accra.

While he unapologetically shook Kenyan social convention  coming out as gay, and later revealing his HIV+ status on Twitter on World AIDS Day in 2016  it often came with backlash, struggle and pain.
Wainaina was a controversial person who struggled with depression and often wrestled with his complicated role as a public figure.
He had his fans but he also faced critics like prominent Kenyan writer Shailja Patel, who accused Wainaina of toxic lesbophobia.
Twitter user Néo Músangi grapples with the fallibility of Wainaina's character in this tweet:
i do not have sufficient energy to engage now but, i am grieving binya, as the dearest of my friends in all my queerness and feminist-ing.
I  am eternally sorry that he hurt others.
I am sorry that he human-ed in those ways.
He would hate us sanitising him.
Writer Bwesigye Mwsigire, director of the Writivism Festival in Uganda, also addressed these contradictions in a Facebook tribute:
His style was a transgression.
Beautiful and freeing transgression.
[T]he people we obsess over because of their work and ideas are people after all.
They are human.
Are we ever ready to love them in their complexity?
By now, a lot has been said about him.
There's no need to repeat what has been said.
Reminders of harm that he supported have been sounded.
This doesn't take away the pain one feels about his death.
There is only one Binyavanga Wainaina.
He is an ancestor now.
Let us celebrate his life.
A creative genius
Kenyan activist Boniface Mwangi wrote on Twitter that after writing a Facebook tribute to Wainaina, hateful, homophobic comments derailed his message:
Wainaina was a creative genius who must be remembered:
I did a very short Facebook post on #RIPBinyavanga and the comments https://t.co/yZ3MoWBnD7 are the vilest l have ever read.
Even the thieves who steal our taxes and kill people don't get as much hate.
Truth is, Binya was a creative genius and he will be read and be remembered.
Ugandan feminist and writer Rosebell Kagumire distills the lessons she learned from Wainainas courage to speak out:
Do not allow the fear.
Don't limit yourself.
Do speak that which needs to be said.
Better yet write it down.
Live your truth and with your heart.
That when you finally finally breathe your last there will be millions of words you brought so much meaning into.#RIPBinyavanga
Through his life and letters, he gave himself and countless others the permission to imagine life as it could be otherwise, and his sudden passing inspired poetic musings:
One day I will write about your gorgeous hair
One day I will write about your laughter
One day I will write about your ungovernability
One day I will write about your delight in imagination
One day I will write about your refusals
Today, I write thank you
Kenyan writer Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor, author of Dust, and literary friend to Wainaina, calls out with a final lament:
Who told you could leave?
Sneak out of your body at night without leaving a new address?
Face tilted, eyes piercing, he said, "You have exactly 3 seconds to reorganise this crap."
You, there. You! Who told you you could leave?
Sneak out of your body at night without leaving a new address?
To whom does one now go in fear and trembling with first draft manuscripts?
Now that he's among the stars, you can join Planet Binya with a full archive of his work.

The Angolan president João Lourenço cancelled, on 18 Abril, the public tender for the fourth mobile phone operator in the country, arguing that the winner Telstar did not meet the necessary requirements to deliver the service.
The presidents decision could indicate divisions in the Angolan government.
The company Telstar was created in January 2018 with a capital stock of 200,000 Kwanza (around 600 US dollars), and its shareholders are the general Manuel João Carneiro (90 per cent) and the businessman António Cardoso Mateus (10 per cent), according to the Portuguese newspaper Observador.
Manuel João Carneiros rank was awarded by the previous president José Eduardo dos Santos, according to the Angolan online news outlet Club Net.
The Observador reported that 27 companies participated in the tendering process opened by the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology, under José Carvalho da Rocha.
On 25 April, João Lourenço signed an order which establishes new rules for opening the new invitation to tender, according to the newspaper Jornal de Angola.
After the results of the first tender were made public, many Angolans questioned the integrity of the process.
Some, for example, highlighted that winner Telstar did not even have a website.
Skit Van Darken, an editor and event organizer, said on Facebook:
Telstar  Telecommunications, Ltd, formed on 26 January 2018, with capital of 200,000 Kwanzas according to the [newspaper] Diário da República, whose shareholders are the general Manuel João Carneiro (90 per cent of the capital), in retirement, and António Cardoso Mateus (10 per cent).
The majority shareholder has links to the company Mundo Startel, a limited liability company, registered at INACOM, the telecommunications regulator, with a landline licence, although expired.
A company that doesnt even have a website!
I DONT EVEN BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE OTHER COMPETITORS
THIS COUNTRY IS A DISGRACE
Meanwhile, Joaquim Lunda, a journalist and frequent social media commentator, praised the presidents action and even thought that the minister in question ran the risk of being fired for these failings:
I appreciate, and it is praiseworthy, the decision taken by the president of the republic, João Lourenço, to annul the public tender which awarded the Angolan company Telstar the licence for the fourth telecommunications operator in Angola.
There were many reservations and a lot of points to clarify around the issue.
One doesnt see the aptitude in a company which was created in 2018 with capital stock of 200 thousand kwanzas to be awarded such an undertaking.
I am completely certain that the days of the Minister of Telecommunications and Information Technology, José Carvalho de Rocha, are numbered.
After the failure of ANGOSAT 1, now also this that we witness today, I doubt if Dread will make it.
Lets enjoy the show calmly!!
The presidents decision came after the same minister led the project, in 2017, for the satellite Angosat 1, also characterized by problems.
For Adriano Sapiñala, a deputy of Angolas biggest opposition party, the case shows disorganization within the government:
JLo [João Lourenço] has to organize his team well because yesterday the minister responsible was saying that the time for complaints had ended and so Telstar would have gone ahead with its next steps given that it was the winner of the fraudulent tender and today JLo comes and annuls the tender!!
You communicate so badly?
Now either the minister makes his position available (resigning) or then JLo has to fire him because if he cancelled the tender it is because it did not go well and to not affect anybody innocent, they need to establish responsibility!!

Blanka Nagy speaking at a rally in January 2019.

This story was written by Tamás B. Kovács and translated by Anita Kőműves for the Hungarian investigative journalism non-profit, Atlatszo.
This edited version appears here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.
Hungarian pro-government media outlets have launched new attacks against Blanka Nagy, a high school student who has spoken out against the government at several protests since late 2018.
Nagy has endured criticism of her intellect and even sexual harassment, with one outlet calling her a whore.
She has already filed and won defamation cases against three pro-government outlets that claimed she was failing in school: Lokál, Ripost, and Origo.
However, after Nady won her case against Origo, the outlet launched another attack, publishing her school reports.
Nagy told Atlatszo that she is considering suing Origo again over these latest stories.
Blanka Nagy became well-known in Hungary last winter after she gave a speech at an anti-government rally, in which she criticized prominent politicians using foul language.
Her harsh words resonated with many social media users and a video of her speech went viral.
About two months after her video became a social media sensation, the pro-government media and pundits such as Zsolt Bayer launched a series of attacks against her.
Pro-government outlets claimed that she was failing many of her subjects in school and that she had missed many days of school.
They also called her an untalented wannabe actress and a whore.
Her attorney filed copies of her academic transcript with the court to prove that she is not failing her classes  and thus the school transcripts became available for attorneys of Origo.
The outlet decided to publish data from her transcripts, claiming that Nagy almost failed history last term and is on the verge of failing in a few other subjects as well.
When #Hungarys pro-govt media lied about teenage protester Blanka Nagy, she sued for defamation and won.
Ordered to issue corrections, however, they've refused and doubled down.
TV2 devoted a whole news segment to mocking her grades, mentioning court documents but not its ruling https://t.co/MyllWb2Jwh
Joost (@almodozo) April 5, 2019
My attorney and I are considering suing the outlet that published my school transcript, Nagy told Atlatszo in an interview.
She says that Origo had no right to publish the transcripts.
She and her attorney did not even think that Origo had the right to see the transcripts when they filed them in court.
And their latest claims are not true either, she said.
I am not failing my history class, contrary to what they say.
I have a much better grade than a 2 (rough equivalent to a C-).
What they say is simply false.
I would be ashamed if it was true because I have a history teacher among my ancestors, she said.
I think all this verbal aggression against me is very strange but I am no longer bothered by it.
It only proves that I somehow scared the highest ranks of governing party Fidesz.
The fact that Zsolt Bayer himself attacked me and the pro-government media is using false pretexts to try and smear me proves that, she added.
Blanka Nagy high schooler: Fidesz is a disgusting, treacherous, ugly & infectious plague.
This disgusting band of thieves,this oligarch-government are filling their pockets for their old days, while you will suffer in poverty as a pensioner.
She told the truth.
THIS is Hungary.
Defamation and disinformation are common weapons of Hungarian pro-government media.
Some opposition figures have responded by suing these outlets for character assassination.
According to data recently obtained by Atlatszo, the most prominent propaganda outlets have lost dozens of cases, and were mandated by the courts to issue corrections to their stories 109 times during 2018.

They can't put their ideas in our heads, so they put bullets #SOSNicaragua reads this protester's sign during a demonstration for political prisoners in Managua.

Since mass protests against president Daniel Ortega erupted in Nicaragua in April 2018, the government has banned demonstrations, arrested thousands without trial, and shut down both alternative and mainstream media outlets.
As attempts at dialogue have so far failed, the future of Nicaragua remains an open question.
The demonstrations were originally against a social security reform that would raise income taxes while reducing pension benefits.
The initial crackdown by the authorities paved the way for a nationwide call for the resignation of President Daniel Ortega and first lady and Vice-President Rosario Murillo.
Figures given for the protests death toll vary, and have not been updated since last year as barriers to documentation efforts increase.
In December 2018 the government closed down several NGOs that were keeping track of police violence and human rights abuses, including the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (Cenidh) and the Institute for the Development of Democracy (Ipade).
Also in December, two groups set up by the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights (IACHR)the Special Follow-up Mechanism for Nicaragua (MESENI) and the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Expertswere expelled from the country, leaving Nicaragua virtually without independent human rights observers and opening a new stage in the repression, according to Nicaraguan feminist activist and educator María Teresa Blandón.

The lowest estimate of the casualties, acknowledged by the government in August 2018, amounted to 197.
Amnesty International, however, has estimated that there have been 322 deaths as of 18 September 2018, most of them caused by gunshots to the head, neck, and torso.
Blogger Ana Siú wrote recently on Medium about her experience of the April 2018 protests:
I saw a friend from University being attacked by a mob through Instagram Live.
I heard her scream and struggle to avoid being hurt [] Finally, the man in the motorcycle [that had attacked her] let her go, but he took her phone.
He didn't realize he was still live.
Then he said Let's go!
We have to take these phones to be checked.
This went on for 20 minutes.
She also reflects on the protest of May 30, a historic rally held on the date Nicaragua celebrates Mother's Day where 15 people were killed:
That day the way we saw the protests change.
Those of us who were in that massive protest saw how they killed young people.
It was the first time they had attacked a mass protest with bullets.
I had never felt so close to death.
While students barricaded themselves in universities in the capital Managua, rural workers blocked roads in the countryside.
In June, protesters in Masaya declared the eastern city a dictatorship-free territory.
The government cracked down on these protesters, who built in barricades to defend themselves and respond to police attacks.
Demonstrators increasingly engaged in more violent methods and confrontations, which resulted in the death of 22 police officers as of August 2018, according to government data.
In mid-2018, the police deployed the so-called operación limpieza (clean-up operation) to dismantle barricades and prosecute suspected participants.
Reports say that law enforcement acted in cooperation with paramilitary groups.
Many students, leaders of peasant movements, rights defenders and journalists were targeted in smear campaigns and persecuted, and some were charged with terrorism.
Even health professionals who treated people injured in the riots suffered consequences.
The Nicaraguan Medical Association said at least 240 such professionals were fired from public hospitals and clinics in retaliation.

In September, protests were made essentially illegal, as all street activities now require advance permission from the authorities, which is often denied.
On February 27, 2019, dialogue was resumed between the government and the opposition party, Alianza Cívica por la Justicia y la Democracia (Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy), following the release of a hundred people from prison.
Unlike previous attempts at dialogue, however, this one did not include leaders of peasant movements and students, as some of them are incarcerated, and others are in exile.
Not just a new president a new beginning
As the country's crisis enters its second year, the urgency and anxiety about Nicaragua's future is conveyed through the hashtag #SOSNicaragua, which is deployed daily in conjunction with allegations, pictures of victims and accounts of students in prison and their families.

Nicaraguan news outlet Niú interviewed Nicaraguans who held a protest in February in neighboring Costa Rica, and they shared accounts of the difficulties of life in exile.
Alejandro Donaire, a student who says he fled the country after participating in a peaceful protest, told Niú how difficult it was to feel part of a functioning society in a normal life, after spending so much time hiding, fleeing or protesting.
Madelaine Caracas, spokesperson of the student group known as the Student Coordination for Democracy, also shared with Niú her aspirations for transformation in Nicaragua, which go beyond Ortega's departure:
[We need to] eradicate authoritarianism, sexism, personal autocracy and other ills that have penetrated the political culture of the country.
We believe more than ever that Ortega will leave this year [] that I will return to Nicaragua this year.
And I have the certainty because Ortega is out of air internationally and economically; and also because those who participated in the uprising last April are now more organized than ever.
This last round of dialogues between government and opposition came to an end on April 3, with agreements reached on two of the four topics discussed.
The government has pledged, firstly, to release all political prisoners and, secondly, to respect civil liberties.
There were no agreements made regarding justice for the victims of violence or the expediting of the 2021 elections.
Opposition group Civic Alliance pointed out, however, that the government has so far failed to honor the agreements.
Police repression of peaceful protests has reportedly continued.
As of April 6, only 50 out of over 600 political prisoners had been released, and those that were were placed under house arrest.
Later, on April 17, following new threats of sanctions from the United States, over 600 prisoners were released to complete their sentences under house arrest, though but according to Civic Alliance, only 18 members of the group were on the list of political prisoners they had hoped to see out of jail.
In the minds of people like activist and researcher Felix Madariaga, the new leaders of Nicaragua's future remain in prison today.
Meanwhile, opposition groups are calling for protests commemorating the anniversary of the events of April 2018.
With the refusal of authorities to grant permission to the demonstration, new police crackdowns are anticipated.

Screenshot of the video shared by the Cauca's Regional Indigenous Council.
The video shares images of the protests that took place in the South West of the country earlier in April.
Indigenous, Afro-Colombian, and farming communities are staging mass protests around Colombia against President Ivan Duque's National Development Plan.
The plan comprises an array of directives that, among other things, will encourage foreign investment in large-scale mining and agribusiness which could threaten indigenous territories.
In March 2019, indigenous communities shut down a major highway in the Cauca region for 25 days.
On April 25, they were joined by other social movements in leading a national strike.
Besides threats to indigenous rights, strikers have protested against budgets cuts in education and the slow implementation of the 2016 Peace Accords  of which Duque, who's still to complete a year in office, is an outspoken critic.
Indigenous peoples have referred to the demonstrations as mingas, a Quechua word meaning collective work widely used in protest movements in South America.
#NationalStrike | Indigenous communities, farmers, and afros of Tado, are mobilizing from the early hours of the morning all along the highway from Pereira to Quibdo as part of the National Strike #It'sWorthItToProtest
The National Development Plan includes reforms in different sectors, such as education, energy, and agriculture.
While Duque claims the programs will lift 3,4 million Colombians out of poverty, critics counter that it benefits primarily private corporations.
Indigenous minga leaders are particularly concerned with the aspects of the plan that might challenge their right to prior consultation on development projects on their territories.
While the government has agreed to negotiate with indigenous leaders about the plan, a final agreement is yet to be reached.
According to the newspaper El Espectador, the amount of land the government is willing to protect on behalf of indigenous peoples are way below of what the communities demand:
The difference between what Iván Duque's government offers and what the indigenous communities are asking for in order to open the Panamericana highway is abysmal.
The President talks about 1,500 hectares to resolve the needs of all the organizations that make up the minga, whereas the requirements of the organizations that are protesting is 40,000 hectares.
Peace accords
Signed between former President Juan Manuel Santos and the leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the country's largest guerrilla group, the 2016 Peace Accords ended the country's five-decade internal conflict by proclaiming a definitive ceasefire in exchange for participation by former FARC members in institutional politics.
The Peace Accords have also created protections to prevent the accumulation of land by individuals and foreign companies in rural areas.
It prioritized land redistribution and designated a few areas for indigenous, Afro-Colombian, and farming communities who have been severely affected by the long conflict.
Unequal land ownership in rural areas was a major reason why FARC group took up arms in the 1960s.
However, full implementation of the agreement has remained elusive as many conservative sectors in Colombia are staunchly against those terms.
Meanwhile, smaller armed groups remain active in the countryside, where they have staged deadly disputes for control over FARC's former territories.
As a consequence, the number of killed social leaders in rural areas has skyrocketed since the Accords signature.
While figures vary depending on how a social leader is defined, the Colombian ombudsman's office says 460 social leaders have been killed between 2016 and March 31, 2019.
Duque, along with his main ally, former President Álvaro Uribe, is among the most prominent detractors of the peace agreement.
In recent months, he has attempted to weaken the authority of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) a judicial body created by the Accords to try both guerrilla and government actors suspected of war crimes.
Many groups are outraged at those measures, which they say could undermine the chances of true reconciliation.
People shared their reasons for joining the April 25 strike with the hashtag #VamosAlParoPor (We Are Going to Strike For) and #MingaNacionalPorLaVida (National Minga For Life).
We are going to strike for the indigenous minga, because we demand protection to social leaders, former fighters, in support of the JEP and the implementation of the peace accords.
For better labor conditions for teachers and workers centrals.
La Pulla, a YouTube channel of political commentary, delved into the growing tension in a video titled This is What Happens when a Government Ignores its People), where they examine the long history of government neglect in the countryside, particularly the departments of Cauca, Nariño, La Guajira, and Catatumbo.
The journalist states:
The minga reminds us that it is not the only place where people live with unfulfilled (promises), with the government flicking them off every time it can.
We see four regions of the country that the state ignores completely.
No definite solution has been given to the minga's and strikers demands, so protests are likely to continue in the coming months.

[Creative Commons (CC BY-NC 2.0)/ Flickr, January 20, 2007]When they awoke on April 28, ready to cast their ballots in Benin's parliamentary election, voters could not rely on WhatsApp or Facebook to communicate with one another, or to seek information about where to vote.
These and several other major web platforms, including Twitter, Instagram, Telegram and Viber, went dark in the early hours of the day.
By 11 am, 99.5 percent of internet connections became inactive, sending the West African country into a nationwide internet shutdown that lasted well into the night.
Human rights groups and election monitors were dismayed but not shocked by the outage, which appears to have been orchestrated by the sitting government.
New electoral laws pushed by the incumbent administration of President Patrice Talon have re-oriented politics in Benin, which until this year had multiple political parties competing with one another.
But under new policies that raise the threshold for party participation in elections, only two political parties made the cut to put up candidates for parliamentary election.
Both parties are closely aligned with the president.
In the lead-up to the election, a series of public protests  which took place despite a blanket ban on street protests  were dispersed by law enforcement officials, who used tear gas and batons to break up demonstrations.
Amnesty International reported that multiple political opposition leaders were arrested during demonstrations.
Open web activists at the Media Foundation for West Africa, Internet Sans Frontieres, CIPESA, Access Now, Global Voices (sub-Saharan Africa) and other groups condemned the shutdown in a joint statement:
The UN Human Rights Committee, the official interpreter of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, emphasizes in General Comment no.34 that restrictions on speech online must be strictly necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate purpose.
[7] Shutdowns, by contrast, disproportionately impact all users, and unnecessarily restrict access to information and emergency services communications during crucial moments.
Shutdowns are neither necessary to, nor effective at, achieving a legitimate aim, as they often spread confusion and encourage more people to join public demonstrations.
We respectfully call on you to:
Ensure that social media is restored
Publicly declare your commitment to keep the internet on, and to notify the public of any disruptions
Encourage telecommunications and internet services providers to respect human rights through public disclosures on policies and practices impacting users.
Speaking with Internet Sans Frontieres, Beninese writer and activist Mylène Flicka of Irawo media noted:
Shutting down the Internet on election day only adds suspicion to an already flawed electoral process.
Benin is now performing very poorly in terms of democracy.
All internet connections had been restored as of the morning of April 29, at which point voting had concluded.

#AllForJan demonstration in memory of murdered journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová in Bratislava, 2 March 2018.
Photo by Peter Tkac, CC BY-SA.
Businessman Marián Kočner has been charged with ordering the killing of journalist Ján Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kušnírová in 2018, according to a March 15 announcement by Slovakia's Special Prosecutions Office.
Before he was killed, Kuciak was working with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and his outlet, Aktuality.sk, to investigate possible links between an Italian criminal group and its presence in Slovakia.
He also wrote about the business dealings of Kočner.
The murders caused widespread shock in the country.
Demands for justice led to massive protests which forced the resignation of then Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Kuciak was the real target while Kušnírová was killed for simply being in their house when the killers barged in.
They were both 27 years old and had planned to marry in May 2018.
According to the prosecution, Kočner personally threatened Kuciak by phone in September 2017 and then ordered the murder that took place on 21 February 2018 in the village of Veľká Mača.
Slovak law enforcement initially detained four people for the killing of Kuciak and Kušnírová.
Kočner's assistant Alena Zsuzsová was accused of paying 50,000 euros (about US $57,000) in cash and the forgiveness of more than 20,000 euros (about US $22,700) in debt to three people  a pizza parlor owner, a former police officer and a former soldier  to organize and commit the murder.
During the summer, Kočner was arrested for financial crimes investigated by Kuciak, but it took authorities six more months to arrest the subordinates of the controversial entrepreneur and directly connect him to the assassination plot.
The reason for the murder was the journalistic work of the victim, a special prosecutor, who was left unnamed for security reasons, told reporters at a March 15 news conference near Bratislava.

The indictment was welcomed by media rights organizations and human rights advocates.
On Twitter, the Committee to Protect Journalists Gulnoza Said stated:
We welcome the news that Slovak authorities have charged a suspected mastermind for the murder of investigative journalist #JánKuciak.
This is a significant step, and a rare one in murders of journalists.
We hope authorities keep their promise to bring all perpetrators to justice, thereby making all journalists in Slovakia safer from violence.
Harlem Desir from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also noted:
I commend today's indictment against instigator of murder of journalist #JanKuciak in #Slovakia.
He paid unacceptable price for investigating corruption at the highest level & has become symbol for freedom of media to tackle mafia & crime.
Full statement: https://t.co/BB8bsemt6K

In May 2018, Kuciak was posthumously awarded the inaugural award for Journalists, Whistleblowers and Defenders of the Right to Information, by the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) in the EU Parliament.
Named for slain Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, the award is intended to recognize the work and courage of individuals in exposing corruption and wrongdoing by the powerful.
Continuing Ján Kuciak's legacy
After Kuciak was murdered, OCCRP and its member centers completed and published some of his unfinished research.
In February 2019, they released a report based titled Unfinished lives, unfinished justice.
This was compiled by OCCRP, the Investigative Reporting Project Italy, Investigace.cz, and the Investigative Centre of Ján Kuciak (ICJK) based on Kuciaks reporting about organized crime in Slovakia and its ties to politics and law enforcement.
But ICJK revealed via Twitter how some authorities were not cooperating with them and that they were prevented from attending the press conference announcing the indictment of Kočner.
Today at 13:00, a press conference to the investigation of Martina and Jans murder will be held at the Special Prosecutor's Office.
We will not be there.
According to the prosecution, we are not journalists, just a curious public who can read it in the paper.
Investigative Center of Jan Kuciak (@icjkuciaka) March 14, 2019
Despite the fact that authorities have now charged the alleged mastermind of the killing, journalists and media advocates insist there are still unresolved questions related to the case, such as the rumored involvement of prominent politicians.
In particular, advocates are interested in learning what the former prime minister Fico and Robert Krajmer, former head of the Anti-Corruption Unit of the Slovak National Crime Agency, may have known about the murders.
Friends and family of Kuciak and Kušnírová have already asked authorities to investigate the ties of newly indicted Kočner with powerful officials that protected him over the last two decades.
Kušnírová's family lawyer is worried that Kočner's close friendship with Slovakias former general prosecutor, Dobroslav Trnka, could affect the progress of the case.

Screenshot of the website papa.mk, set up by the Government of Republic of North Macedonia on occasion of the Pope's visit on 7 May 2019.
Pope Francis will visit North Macedonia in May 2019, just two days after the second round of presidential elections.
It will be the first time a pope visits North Macedonia.
The visit is part of a three-day regional tour which will also include a stop in Bulgaria.
The government of North Macedonia has set up a website, papa.mk to facilitate the visit.
In line with the multicultural character of the country, the website contents are available in three languages: Macedonian, Albanian and English.
Some citizens have questioned the government's ownership of the website, claiming that it contradicts the country's secular character.
Macedonian citizens can apply for tickets to the Pontiff's Holy Mass, which are free of charge, through local churches, while foreigners must secure their places through the website.
The Mass will take place at the main square of the capital Skopje on May 7.
Catholics make up less than one percent of the population of North Macedonia, where about 65 percent have professed faith for Orthodox Christianity and about 33 percent are Muslim.
Despite its small size, the local Catholic community is considerably diverse as it includes ethnic Macedonians, Albanians, Croats, Slovenes, and Poles.
On the other hand, the country has religious significance for Catholicism because the capital Skopje is the birthplace of Mother Theresa (1910-1997), officially honored as Saint Theresa of Calcutta.
One of the most popular missionaries of the 20th century, and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, she was born in an ethnic Albanian family whose house was situated precisely on what is now the main town square.
The political aspect of the visit surpasses its religious significance.
As a head of state, the pontiff is scheduled to meet the prime minister and the outgoing president, whose mandate will end five days afterward.
The Macedonian public appears to see the visit as a sign of recognition by the West, and a boost to the government's efforts to bring the country closer to membership of NATO and the European Union.
Such sentiment is apparent in a tweet from retired police general Stojanche Angelov, who commented on the preparatory visit by the chief of Macedonian Public Safety Bureau to the Vatican.
Thanks to the wise, brave and determined international politics of this government, our small state moves forward with great strides!
The Director of PSB Sasho Tasevski prepares the highest security level for the Pope Francis stay in Skopje.
Stevo [Pendarovski] for president!
A month ahead of Pope's journey, Vatican News, the information system of the Holy See, added Macedonian language to its repertoire.
It is the 34th language available on the portal.
Skopje Bishop Kiro Stojanov said this is a first-fruit of Pope Francis Apostolic Visit.
Ahead of #PopeFrancis Apostolic Journey to #NorthMacedonia on 7 May, @VaticanNews adds a page dedicated to the Macedonian language.
In September, the Pope will visit Mozambique, Madagascar, and Mauritius.

Video shared on YouTube by Agence France Press in Spanish.
On April 5, a group of around 20 Colombian activist collectives delivered a formal request to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for it open a criminal investigation about the mass killings of social leaders in their country.
The collectives and their supporters delivered the letter in person at The Hague after marching for over a week from Paris, while stopping in different cities in France and Belgium along the way where they've staged rallies and performances.
The photo below is from the kick-off gathering in Paris:
A homage to the 472 social leaders assassinated in Colombia, the walkers of The Hague made a piece of fabric with the names of [each of] the 472 [leaders].
We hope the government has enough with their security policies and this number doesn't continue swelling.
The march was spearheaded by The Netherlands Colombian Citizens Diplomacy Collective with other groups joining forces later on.
Participants have used the hashtag #MarchamosALaHaya (Marching to The Hague) and #MarchamosALaHaya5abril (Marching to The Hague April 5) to spread information about the initiative.
Colombian politicians Gustavo Bolívar and Antonio Sanguino have expressed support for the march.
Senator Gustavo Petro, who lost presidential elections in 2010 and 2018, also participated in the march through his organization Colombia Humana (Human Colombia).
A video by Adriaan Alsema, the founder of online media outlet Colombia Reports, shows some images of previous protests that were staged inside and outside Colombia against the killings of social leaders.
It also includes a brief explanation of the problem.
Over 163  community leaders and activists  referred under the umbrella term líderes sociales in Colombia  have been murdered over the past three years in Colombia, according to the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The Colombian Ombudsman has a much higher figure  over 460 killings since 2016.
By any accounts, the number of violent deaths has soared since the 2016 peace agreement that for the most part ended the country's decades-long conflict between the government and the guerrilla group FARC.
Among many other directives, the peace agreement stipulates that the FARC will surrender all assets in exchange for participation in institutional politics.
But the FARC has left a vacuum of power since it left its former territories, which have now been occupied either by paramilitary groups or guerrilla dissidents that don't accept the peace process.
Social leaders are targeted for defending their communities from such groups, who usually run a monopoly on illegal drug trade or illegal mining on the areas they control.
According to Carlos Guevara, who coordinates the organization Somos Defensores (we are defenders, in Spanish), the social leaders are often killed in their own homes, in front of their families, and usually have no support from authorities when they seek justice:
Aggressions against people devoted to defend human rights in Colombia [has reached the level of] a humanitarian crisis [] they're being killed because they're pushing to move away from an economy deemed illegal and beneficial to drug traffickers and armed groups.
The Government is not taking action to protect these leaders
Meanwhile, The National Conference of Afrocolombian Organizations highlights an important aspect of the mass killings that tends to be set aside: the fact that most social leaders belong to ethnic minorities.
In addition, female leaders suffer from an additional layer of violence, as they are subjected to additional kinds of gender-based aggressions.
Colombia Twitter often uses the hashtag #NosEstánMatando (they're killing us) to talk about the killings of social leaders.
With the ICC march, activists hope to raise the international profile of their plight.
Meanwhile, the numbers don't cease to soar.
Since the start of 2019, 73 social leaders have been threatened just in the central Boyacá department.

After beating five competitors, the athlete won first place in the category of classic bodybuilding (classic physique), the most popular and important category in the event, which seeks to find the athlete who best displays their musculature in various positions.
Bruno also won in the overall category for the best athlete across all the sub-categories.
He participated in three categories in the Hong Kong Bodybuilding contest: mens athletic physique, mens fitness physique, mens sports model.
The contest is scheduled to be held next on 23 June.
In response to our request sent by Facebook chat about how the competition went, Saraiva highlighted that it was his first time at the contest, as well as the limited time he had for preparation:
Eu fui preparado pelo Castro Cazé em apenas poucos dias e lá fomos fazer as inscrições, e ele disse Bruno tu vais fazer a categoria que eu sempre quis que fizesses: a mais conhecida por Classic Physique e logo na minha primeira aparição ganhei na minha categoria e fui ganhar ainda o overall, como se fosse chamar todos os primeiros lugares da tua categoria.
I was trained by Castro Cazé in only a few days and then we went to do the registration, and he said Bruno youre going to do the category that I always wanted you to do: the one best known as Classic Physique and soon in my first appearance I won in my category and I then also won the overall, as it is called for all the first places of your category
Followed by over 24 thousand people on his Instagram account, Bruno, who resides in the capital Maputo, is a figure of reference for bodybuilders in Mozambique.
According to the Wikipedia entry for bodybuilding:
Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature for aesthetic purposes.
An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder.
In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, and conditioning.
Saraiva expressed his happiness with winning the award in Hong Kong in an Instagram post:
Thank you for the victory, Lord.
It is with much joy that I have the pleasure of announcing and sharing with you all my victory in the category Classic Physique and having won the overall in the global classic competition in Hong Kong
In another post, though, Bruno recounted the difficulties he went through before going to Hong Kong:
Please my friend read this message with a lot of kindness, because it is the purest reality.
I have no shame in saying it and I know that many will overreact.
When I was about to come to Hong Kong to compete I went around a lot of places knocking on doors asking for support, I spoke with various friends some of whom I was sure could help, and the answers from some were:
1.Bruno you're not going to make it or you dont have any chance of winning nor of finishing among the best;
2.Others said that they couldnt help me because it would be throwing away the money;
3.Others even said Bruno you must be smoking a lot of cannabis.

Article 50
Ould Mkhaitir was sentenced to death in 2014 over an opinion piece published online.
Despite having his death sentence commuted more than a year ago, Mauritanian blogger Mohamed Cheikh Ould Mkhaitir is still in prison.
Ould Mkhaitir was sentenced to death in 2014 over an opinion article published on the website of the newspaper Aqlame.
In the article, entitled Religion, Religiosity and Craftsmen, Ould Mkhaitir criticised the role of religion in Mauritanias caste system, using stories from the lifetime of prophet Muhammad to support his argument.
The original article has since been taken down by Aqlame, but is still available online.
A court convicted him of apostasy and sentenced him to death under Article 306 of the Mauritanian Penal Code.
In April 2016, a court of appeal upheld his sentence and referred his case to the Supreme Court, which then returned it to the appeal court for procedural irregularities.
In November 2017 his death sentence was commuted and reduced to two years in jail and a fine by the court of appeal.
However, despite having already served more than two years in prison, the authorities did not release Ould Mkhaitir.
Almost 18 months after the appeal court's decision to release him, he remains behind bars.
On April 24, 2019 Mauritania's justice minister said that Mkhaitir was in temporary detention and that only the Supreme Court can rule on his fate.
Article 306 of the Penal Code previously provided that if the convicted person repents before his or her execution, the Mauritanian Supreme Court could commute the death sentence to a jail sentence of between three months and two years, and a fine.
But in April 2018, the Mauritanian National Assembly passed a law making the death penalty mandatory for anyone convicted of blasphemous speech and acts deemed sacrilegious.
The timing of the enactment of the law just a few months after the court of appeal ordered Mkhaïtirs release appears to be related to his case, Human Rights Watch said in November 2018.
Critiques of racism and the caste system are taboo in Mauritania, and have spurred many political and legal threats against journalists and activists in recent years.
In 1981, Mauritania became the last country on earth to officially abolish slavery, and only criminalized the practice in 2007.
But since that time, UN officials and human rights workers have documented evidence that thousands of people, many of them ethnic Haratines of black African origin, are still enslaved, living in situations of forced labour, or otherwise facing caste-based discrimination.
The Mauritanian government denies that slavery still exists in the country, and many people like Ould Mkhaitir, who speak out against the practice and discrimination against Haratines, have been jailed and prosecuted.
Last September, authorities jailed and charged activist Abdallahi Salem Ould Yali with incitement to violence and racial hatred for posting messages in WhatsApp group denouncing the plight and the marginalisation of his community.

Article 51
Shawkan enjoying a day out, before he is locked again for the night.
Photo taken by Wael Abbas and posted on the photojournalist's Twitter account.
Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid, also known as Shawkan, spent five years in prison for simply doing his job as a journalist.
He was detained on August 14, 2013 as he was photographing the deadly dispersal of the Rabaa El Adaweya sit-in, in which supporters of former Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi gathered to protest a military coup that ended his presidency on July 3 that same year.
Egyptian security forces killed at least 817 people and injured many more, according to Human Rights Watch, when they dispersed the sit-in.
Shawkan, who was working for Demotix at the time of his arrest, spent almost four years in pre-trial detention before his trial, along with 739 other defendants in what came to be known as the Rabaa Dispersal Case, began.
In September 2018, a Cairo Criminal Court convicted him on spurious charges of murder and affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, and a few months later he was released from jail.
Shawkans supporters were thrilled to see him reunited with his loved ones when he was released on March 4.
But the journalist is actually only partially free.
Every evening at 6pm, he has to report to his local police station where he has to spend the night, before he is free again at 6am the following morning.
Shawkan needs to do this every day for five years after his release.
I want to be free so I can return to normal life, Shawkan told Deutsche Welle after his release in reference to his probation period.
On Twitter and Instagram, the journalist has been reflecting and posting about his life under these restrictive conditions and his daily hours of freedom, from 6am to 6pm.
On March 31, he posted about his visit to the pyramids in Giza.
The pyramids are at the back.
A trip nearby the place of supervision [police station where he has to spend the night] because of the [lack of] time.
On April 6, using the hashtag _# (half freedom in English) he posted a photo on Instagram, taken from his seat on a motorcycle.
He explained that in order to arrive to the police station on time each night, he travels by motorcycle so he can avoid traffic.
Shawkans story is not unique in Egypt.
Prominent Egyptian blogger and activist Alaa Abd El Fattah, who was released from jail on March 28, is also under a similar probation period.
Alaa spent five years in jail for defying a protest ban, and like Shawkan, he has to spend the night at a police station for the next five years.
Freedom for Alaa.
Since his release, Alaa has been speaking out against the conditions of his probation.
Photo by the Freedom for Alaa campaign.
Alaa has also been reflecting on life under probation.
I am happy to see your joy over my release, but I am unfortunately not free, Alaa wrote on Facebook days after his release.
Every day I surrender myself to a humiliation called [police] monitoring.
In another post, he wrote: I do not know how to describe the beautiful feeling of seeing [his son] Khaleds swimming lesson for the first time.
I also dont know how to describe the cruelty of leaving him in mid-lesson to be on time for the monitoring.
Alaas sister, Mona Seif, who is also a human rights activist, likened the conditions of her brothers imprisonment every night to solitary confinement.
Alaa has to turn himself in to Dokki police station every day at 6 pm and they let him go at 6 am.
When he turns himself in, they keep him isolated from all others in a small wooden kiosk within the police station.
They lock him in for 12 hrs.
These are worst conditions than the ones he had to endure in prison for five years.
Alaa is practically now spending half his day in solitary confinement in the police station, and he is looking at five years more of this nightmare
Alaa has also learned that speaking out against these conditions can pose a risk of additional jail time.
On the night of April 9, security officers threatened to throw him back in jail if he keeps exposing the conditions of his probation.
Ahmed Maher, a political activist with the April 6 Youth Movement, spent three years behind bars for illegal demonstration.
He was released in January 2017 and placed under police monitoring a period equal to the amount of time he spent in jail.
On Twitter, he described the conditions of this period:
Under police monitoring, where we sleep is much dirtier than in prison and there is more arbitrariness, even though according to law, they do not have the right to imprison us in a police station or to deprive us of our children, our work, our studies and our normal lives.
According to law, monitoring should be more gentle and more humane, but it is clear that the motivation is nothing but a desire to abuse and humiliate.
This practice of locking former prisoners overnight is an abuse of power.
According to legal analysts and human rights NGOs, those placed under monitoring are supposed to be able to spend the night in their homes.
Only those who are without a place to live in the area of their local police station, are required to spend the night in official custody.
Yasmin Omar and Mai El-Sadaby of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy wrote:
After an individual is sentenced to a probation period decided by the judge at sentencing, the law empowers the sentenced individual to designate a residence at which to serve his or her probation period.
However, the law additionally authorizes authorities to select a location for probation if no residence is provided, as well as to determine whether or not a location selected by the defendant is appropriate for police surveillance.
This discretion has been used to systematically erode the right of individuals to complete their probation periods at their stated residencea right guaranteed to them under lawand instead force individuals who have residences where police surveillance can clearly occur to spend them at police stations.
Yet at the end of each day, many Egyptians are forced to retreat to a small cell in a police station, away from their loved ones and the rest of the world: they are out of prison, but not really free.
Many are activists, protesters and journalists, whose only crimes were to exercise their fundamental rights to freedom of expression, assembly and protest.

Army officers on patrol in Rio de Janeiro, in 2018.

On April 7, a Sunday, musician Evaldo dos Santos Rosa, 51, was on his way to a baby shower in Guadalupe, a poor neighborhood in the city of Rio de Janeiro.
In the car with him were his father-in-law, his wife, their 7-year-old son, and a friend.
The sun was up, and it seemed like a regular weekend in Brazil's largest coastal city.
As they drove by an army compound nearby, soldiers fired a hail of bullets towards the car.
Evaldo was killed on the spot, while his father-in-law along with a passerby that was near the scene were injured.
The other passengers managed to escape.
The police, which inspected the scene, later revealed the car was shot 80 times.
Leonardo Salgado, police chief, said he believed the officers mistook Evaldo's car to another one used by criminals which they were after, according to news website G1.
He added that police didn't find any weapons on Evaldo's car.
Luciana Nogueira, Evaldo's wife of 27 years who survived the shooting, told Estado de S. Paulo:
Os vizinhos começaram a socorrer (o meu marido), mas eles continuaram atirando.
Eu botei a mão na cabeça, pedi socorro, disse pra eles que era meu marido, mas eles não fizeram nada, ficaram de deboche.
The neighbors started to help (my husband), but [the soldiers] kept shooting.
I put my hands on my head, cried for help, told them that he was my husband, but they didnt do anything, the just stood there with debauchery.
While the brutal murder of an innocent man by state officials has shocked Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro remained silent about the incident for six days.
When he finally spoke, at a press conference on April 12, he said: The army didn't kill anyone, the army is of the people, and you can't accuse the people of murder.
Previously, the only words that came out of Planalto Palace, the executive's seat, was through the president's spokesperson, who referred to Evaldo's execution as an incident without offering condolences to his family.
In the evening of April 8, Rio de Janeiro's State Governor Wilson Witzel, an ally of Bolsonaro, declared that it wasnt up to him to make a judgment
Two days later, Minister of Justice and Public Security Sergio Moro only said the killing was unfortunate during an interview to a TV show.
Número de menções no Twitter do primeiro escalão do governo Bolsonaro ao fuzilamento de um carro de família no Rio de Janeiro
Sim, o gráfico está VAZIO, pois ninguém se posicionou, nem ao menos para lamentar o ocorrido
O carro foi atingido por 80 tiros disparados p/ militares pic.twitter.com/K2tbvxwrff
Gabriel Zanlorenssi (@gzanlorenssi) April 9, 2019
This is the number of mentions on Twitter by Bolsonaros cabinet to the shooting aimed at a family car in Rio de Janeiro.
Yes, the graphic is EMPTY, because no one manifested themselves, not even to say they felt sorry for what happened.
The car was shot 80 times by military men.
Military investigation
Shortly after news about the episode began circulating in the media, the army put out a statement saying its men were responding to unfair aggression by assailants.
Later in the evening of April 7, it released a different note, this time saying that it would conduct an investigation.
Although the civil police inspected the scene, they will not investigate the case.
The army itself will do it instead, and a military court will eventually try the soldiers.
That's thanks to a 2017 law that says armed forces themselves are responsible for investigating homicides committed by their personnel while on duty.
Human Rights Watch, who has criticized the law at the time of its approval by President Michel Temer, put out a statement on April 9 calling for an impartial investigation of the murder of Evaldo, and for the law to be repealed.
On April 8, the military arrested 10 of the 12 officers who had been deployed to the scene and charged them with homicide and attempted homicide, according to local newspaper Extra.
A judge released one of the 10 officers on April 10 following a hearing.
Not the first time
Brazil's police are known for shooting first, asking later, a saying that has been proven right time and again.
An International Amnestys report released this year says Brazilian police is the most deadly in the world.
Only in 2018, 15,6 percent of all homicides in the country were committed by law enforcement agents.
Just in Rio de Janeiro state, and just in January 2019, police have killed 160 people.
A bill dubbed anticrime package which the Bolsonaro's government is proposing in Congress could potentially increase those already-staggering figures.
The bill seeks to change several directives that will either scrape or significantly reduce penalties of police and military officers when they kill someone while on duty.
The circumstances of the murder of Evaldo, a 51-year-old black man, is not an exception but the rule in Brazil, as Samira Bueno and Renato Sérgio de Lima, directors of the Brazilian Forum of Public Security, have said in an article for Folha de São Paulo:
Evaldo teve sua vida ceifada por aqueles que juraram defendê-la.
Seu filho jamais se livrará do trauma de ter assistido ao pai ser fuzilado por agentes estatais.
Mas que fique claro que a culpa não é apenas daqueles que apertaram o gatilho.
Ou começamos a responsabilizar toda a cadeia de comando pelos atos cometidos, ou vamos continuar contando os nossos mortos e desacreditando as nossas instituições.
Evaldo has had his life taken from him by those who had sworn to defend it.
His son will never be over the trauma of watching his father being shot at by state agents.
But let us be clear that the fault lies not only with those who have pulled the trigger.
Either we start holding the entire chain of command accountable to their acts, or we will continue to count our dead while discrediting our institutions.

Dr. Wairagala Wakabi [Image by CIPESA and used with permission]Wairagala Wakabi, a leading digital rights advocate from Uganda, was detained at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on April 25.
Wakabi was invited to speak at the annual Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Day hosted by the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition (THRDC).
Wakabi is the Executive Director of the Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA), one of the foremost organizations working on internet policy and online free speech in Africa.
Wakabi was deported back to Uganda after several hours of interrogation, during which he was denied access to a lawyer.
Attorneys from the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition attempted to advocate on his behalf, but were told only that Wakabi was being deported on grounds of national interest:
UPDATE: After hours of interrogation, Dr. Wakabi has been deported back to #Uganda this evening.
However, lawyers remained unable to establish the basis of the detention & deportation.
They report that authorities denied him entry into #Tanzania on grounds of national interest.

CIPESA (@cipesaug) April 25, 2019
Though the ordeal lasted only a few hours, it brought great consternation among rights advocates in the region, who have grown wary of Tanzania's treatment of activists and journalists.
In November last year, Angela Quintal and Muthoki Mumo both staff of Committee to Protect Journalists, were detained for several hours in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and had their passports temporarily seized.
Is Tanzania on a deliberate crusade to silence human rights defenders by harassing them in order to dissuade them from coming into the country?
Late last year it was @pressfreedoms @angelaquintal and @muthokimumo not Dr Wakabi?
This cannot silence us!

Human Rights Watch asserted that Tanzania under the leadership President John Magufuli has witnessed a marked decline in respect for free expression, association and assembly.
In 2015, the United Republic of Tanzania promulgated the Cybercrimes Act.
Within a year of the passing of that law, at least 14 Tanzanians were arrested and prosecuted under the law for insulting the president on social media.
March 2018 saw the passing of the Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations, making it mandatory for bloggers to register and pay roughly US $900 per year to publish online.
This caused many independent blogs to go dark.
The stifling of independent media through a mixture of sanctions against media outlets and legal threats against journalists has created an atmosphere of intimidation, self-censorship and fear of expressing alternative views about the countrys leaders.
The detention and subsequent deportation of Wakabi back to Uganda appears to be a continuation of the Tanzania's government assault on free speech and dissent.

Article 54
Alpha Condé at the World Economic Forum in 2012 CC BY-SA 2.0
Although Guineas constitution allows only two consecutive terms in office, the country's current president, Alpha Condé, recently announced that he intended to seek a third term.
To help achieve this, he has not hesitated to make calls to violence.
In an analysis published on Horizon Guinée, Sonny Camara, a journalist based in Conakry (the country's capital), reported parts of a speech the president made on March 24, 2019:
I will be taking off my president's hat.
I am putting on my activist's hat, because now I am ready to fight against these people [in the opposition] [] Be ready for confrontation [] Nobody in Guinea will stop me from going before my people to ask them what they want [for the country] [] If [the opposition] wants to walk all over you, be ready to walk all over them so that they know that you are afraid of nothing.
Condé was elected as President of Guinea in 2010 as the first freely elected president in the country's history.
However, the 2010 elections were not without controversies as observers, including the Carter center reported that nearly 1 million voters ballot were lost from the final count.
Condé was reelected in 2015 with almost 58 percent of the vote.
in 2016,  
FRANCE 24 news channel reported that the mining company Rio Tinto paid Guinean government official $10.5 million for mining rights in the Simandou Region.
A few months after his re-election in May 2015, Condé began to suggest his intention to seek a third term.
Ibrahima Diallo, director of Liberté FM, a radio station in Conakry, highlighted this 2016 report on Nouvelles de Guinée:
Mais, à entendre Alpha Condé dire à lopinion publique nationale et internationale que le «souverain peuple» de Guinée décidera ou non dun troisième mandat pour lui sous  entend que celui qui voulait être la «synthèse» de feu Mandela et dObama pour son pays est «pire» que ses prédécesseurs quil a toujours combattus durant sa vie déternel opposant.
Aujourdhui, quand Koro dit «cest le peuple qui décidera», il veut juste faire porter par le vaillant peuple de Guinée le mérite pour lui de briguer «un éventuel mandat» après les deux consécutifs.
But, to hear Alpha Condé say to national and international audiences that the sovereign people of Guinea will decide whether or not he will have a third term implies that he who wanted to be the synthesis of the late Mandela and Obama for his country is worse than his predecessors, whom he has fought all his life as an eternal opponent.
Today, when Koro (ed's note: nickname for Alpha Condé) says its the people who will decide, he just wants to make the valiant people of Guinea legitimize his seeking a possible term after the two consecutive ones.
Condé stuck to his plan by taking measures to ensure he avoided any bad surprises, including dismissing the president of the constitutional court, Kéléfa Sall, a move which did not follow legal procedure.
Amadou Tham Camara, a reporter with Guinée News, wrote:
After the undermining of the CENI [the national independent electoral commission], it is now the second constitutional institution in charge of national elections which has been irreparably weakened.
From now on, for the party in power, there is an avenue to having the qualified majority of two thirds of deputies during the legislative elections scheduled for the first quarter of 2019.
This majority being the necessary condition for initiating the revision of the constitution.
It is thus a giant step which has been taken to break through the constitutional lock which limits the number of terms as President of the Republic at two.
It seems that Sall's mistake was to warn Condé  during his second term swearing-in ceremony, no less  against modifying the constitution.
Sall said then:
The management of the nation must gather us around what is essential.
We do not surround ourselves with extremists who are harmful to national unity.
Always avoid slips toward paths forbidden under democracy and good governance.
Refrain from succumbing to the song of revisionist sirens because, although the people of Guinea gave you and renewed their confidence, they nevertheless remain legitimately vigilant.
The reaction of Guineans has been lively.
At a press conference on March 29, organized by former members of the National Transition Council (a type of interim parliament) and hosted by the collective Ne Touche pas à ma Constitution (Dont Touch My Constitution), Boubacar Siddighy Diallo, one of the speakers, recalled that Guineas constitution comprises two parts which form an indivisible whole.
He made the point that together, these parts shield the constitution from any possible tampering which could have consequences that compromise the peace and stability of our country.
Opponents reacted strongly.
At an opposition meeting, Cellou Dalein Diallo, president of the Union des Forces Démocratiques de Guinée (The Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea, a liberal political party), said:
The Republican opposition has reaffirmed its readiness to form a coalition with all the active movements of the nation, to oppose democratic retreat and the presidency for life that Alpha Condé wants to grant himself
Sekou Koundouno, leader of the Forces Sociales de Guinée (FSG) the Social Forces of Guinea) announced on Facebook that his civil society group wrote to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court asking her to keep a close eye on our country and take a public stand to avoid chaos in Guinea.
Similarly, Guinean citizens reacted on Twitter:
The words of the president of the republic are extremely serious for peace and social calm in Guinea.
Yet again, I strongly condemn this not very honourable habit of our country.
We absolutely must call on the CEDEAO [the Economic Community of West African States], the African Union, the UN, etc.
Everywhere in Guinea, the people are speaking out against the third term.
Such was the case in Coyah [a prefecture in Guinea's Kindia region] earlier. Four young people were reportedly arrested on the instructions of one of the promoters of the third term.
No intimidation will stop Guineans in their quest for democracy.
Popular Facebook personality Alimou Sow chose irony as a way of commenting on the situation, alluding to the strong winds which hit Conakry on the night of April 2:
It seems that in Greek mythology Aeolus was the god of the winds (whence the adjective Aeolian).
So, to Guinea Aeolus went that night to blow away, not only the demagogic posters, but also those who put them up and promote the third [term] #Nambara [Problems].
Gone with the wind.
Good night #ennui
The most significant reaction, however, came from the Guinean writer and economist, Ibrahima Sanoh.
On January 2, he launched his movement, Patriotes pour lAlternance et le Salut (Patriots for Alternation and Salvation), to oppose any attempt by Condé to seek a third term in 2020.

In March 2019, Mozambican professor Emília Nhalevilo took office as dean of the recently-created Púnguè University, becoming thus the first women to ever lead a public university in the African country.
She was nominated by President Filipe Nyusi, but the decision about the recently-created universities was announced by the Council of Ministers on January 29.
Nhalevilo will remain in office, in principle, for a period of four years.
Born in Nampula, the most populous province in Mozambique, Nhalevilo holds a doctorate and master's degree in education from the University of Perth, Australia, and a bachelor's degree in science education from Pedagogical University (UP).
From 2005 to 2007, she worked as Professor at Curtin University of Technology, in Australia.
In 2008, Nhalevilo became the head of the chemistry department at UP, and then took office as deputy director of the Center for Mozambican Studies and Ethnoscience, a research center at the same institution.
In 2017, she was a fellow with the Fulbright Visiting Scholar Program at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development of New York University, in the United States.
Nhalevilo was the vice-dean for research and extension in the UP since 2018.
As dean of a public university, her current position is equivalent to that of a minister in Mozambique.
Eliana Nzualo, an activist and feminist blogger, says Nhalevilo's appointment is a historic moment:
UM DIA NA HISTÓRIA
Professora Doutora Emília Nhalevilo é a primeira mulher na liderança de uma Universidade Pública em Moçambique.
Parabéns à Magnífica Reitora!
Por mais mulheres nas Universidades,
Por mais mulheres na liderança!
HISTORY DAY
Professor Emília Nhalevilo is the first woman to lead a Public University in Mozambique.
Congratulations to the Magnificent Rector!
For more women in the Universities,
For more women in the lead!
In Mozambique, women still face challenges in accessing leadership and management positions.
But there have been improvements: in the current parliament, for example, both the president of the assembly and the heads of the two largest political caucus are women.
But gender inequality still prevails in the southern African country.
The UNDP's 2016 Africa Human Development Report, whose title is Accelerating Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Africa, revealed that Mozambican women and girls continue to suffer from inequalities, such as poor access to justice, poor access to school and health care, and repeated acts of violence.
In 2018, there were 25,356 cases of domestic violence in Mozambique, of which 12,500 were against women and 9,000 against children.
Mozambique ranks 10th in the world for child marriages, according to a UNICEF report from 2015.
The organization defines child marriage as a marital union in which at least one person is under the age of 18.
In mid-2018, pilot Admira António became the first woman to ever captain a flight in Mozambique, while in December 2018, an all-female flight crew took to the skies for the first time.
In 2014, when the Police of the Republic of Mozambique turned 39, Arsenia Massingue was presented as the first woman general in the corporation.

Pope Francis will visit Mozambique in September 2019, just weeks before elections that will choose the new president, members of the Republican Assembly, and provincial governors.
The Pope was invited by Mozambiques president, Filipe Nyusi, in September 2018.
The visit was announced as confirmed on 26 March in a solemn ceremony which involved bodies of the Catholic Church in the country.
President Nyusi said that the Popes visit would help to strengthen peace talks with the opposition party RENAMO, which stopped military hostilities with the government in 2017 as part of a process which is still fraught with tensions.
He added that it would also be an occasion to reflect on the conflict with paramilitary groups acting in the north of the country, specifically in the province of Cabo Delgado.
John Paul II was the last pope to visit Mozambique, in September 1988.
The confirmation of the Popes visit had already been anticipated since mid-February.
Mozambique will hold elections this October and it's still recovering from the devastation of Cyclone Idai, which left over 500 dead and more than a million homeless.
The Pope has shown solidarity with the victims:
Expresso a minha dor e a minha solidariedade às queridas populações de Moçambique, Zimbábue e Malauí, atingidas pelo ciclone Idai.
Confio as inúmeras vítimas e suas famílias à misericórdia de Deus.
#PrayForAfrica #cycloneIdai
Papa Francisco (@Pontifex_pt) 20 mars 2019
I express my pain and my solidarity with the beloved peoples of Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, hit by Cyclone Idai.
I entrust the countless victims and their families to the mercy of God.
The disaster caused by the cyclone, already considered one of the worst to have ever hit the Southern Hemisphere, struck the city of Beira in central Mozambique on 14 March, and then hit the neighbouring countries of Zimbabwe and Malawi.
More than 300 people died in these two countries.
Since then, the country has remained in a state of emergency, which has led the government to review the electoral calendar and postpone the registration period.
In the middle of a disaster, govnt still trying to figure out how to rescue & accommodate thousands of people after #CycloneIdai, president Nyusi gives LIVE tv statement to the nation to announce that the Pope is set to visit Mozambique in September.
Bad timing is understatement.
Zenaida Machado (@zenaidamz)
The fact that the elections will be held soon after the papal visit has raised questions from some citizens, who are concerned that it could have an impact on campaigning:
It is clear that Pope Francis visit in September plays in favour of #Frelimo and Filipe #Nyusi.
Directly or indirectly the visit will be politically profited from.
It would be good if it was postponed to November, that is, after the confusion of the general elections scheduled for 15 October.

The phenomenon didn't start with the Netflix series, but Narcos certainly helped revive 1980s Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's status in North American popular culture.
Since it premiered in 2015, the controversial series has fueled conversations about Colombia's persistent international image as a cocaine paradise dominated by charismatic drug traffickers.
As a response, the Colombian journalists behind YouTube channel La Pulla (in Spanish, the taunt), a project by Colombian newspaper El Espectador, made a video responding to people who still glorify Escobar as a hero.
Among other things, the video highlights tragic episodes  and statistics  of one of the darkest periods of Colombia's history, such as the assassination of El Espectador's former director Guillermo Cano on December 17, 1986, and the bomb attack next to their offices in September 1989.
It is common in other countries to see people with T-shirts of him, encouraged by series such as Netflix's Narcos.
And then when they come to Colombia they pay a lot of money to go on a tour so they can admire his great accomplishments.
This hero prompted thousands of people to run towards drug trafficking money [like] pigeons chasing corn and rendered the national economy into a little pot to launder the money that came from drug trafficking.
This hero was not a friend of the people: he committed 623 attacks, left 1710 civilians in pain, and killed 402.
This hero forced us to escape from an abandoned briefcase in the street or from a stationed car with no one inside [thinking] there [it was] one more bomb.
This hero forced us to stay indoors, to suspect from everyone, and to react with fire and violence.
This hero forced us to live in constant fear.
The tours referenced in the video are known as Narco Tours, and they guide tourists around the city of Medellin through famous spots related to Pablo Escobar's life.
In 2018, Global Voices partner Radio Ambulante described the tour in one of the episodes of their award-winning podcast.

A photo of the deputy Ana Paula on the first day in office.
Source: Facebook Personal Page, fair use.
For her state legislature inauguration on January 31, newly-elected Brazilian deputy Ana Paula da Silva wore a bright red dress and jewelry.
She posted a photo of the occasion on her Facebook and, on the next day, she woke up with a flurry of hateful comments.
The reason: her cleavage.
Ana Paula da Silva is one of the five women out of 40 legislators elected to the legislative assembly of Santa Catarina, a southern Brazilian state.
Her photo received 6,400 comments and 6,447 shares, including many offenses and threats.
But that is not the first time in Brazil that a woman's outfit choice has eclipsed her skills on her workplace
Male guide to female attire
In 2009, Porto Alegre city councilor Fernanda Melchionna took to the house's tribune wearing a black-and-white striped tie to protest a bill that would impose a dress code on female legislators.
Melchionna, who is now a state deputy, usually goes to work wearing jeans and trainers, which a male colleague thought was inappropriate.
She said that the debate around women's wardrobes was fit for the lazy, for those who do not use their mandates to work on social problems.
It is not only in politics that women go through such experiences.
In 2017, lawyer Pamela Helena de Oliveira Amaral vowed to sue a judge after he interrupted a trial to scold her choice of clothing.
Pamela was wearing a long blue dress that revealed her shoulders.
Judge Eugênio Cesário left the room and only came back after Pamela had borrowed a blazer from a female colleague.
Pamela said in an interview at that time:
I was astonished, confused.
I still haven't quite comprehended it all.
It was humiliating, embarassing and disturbing what he made me go through in front of my colleagues.
The room was full of students and other lawyers.
On a post titled Girl Power and Power Dressing: femininity in politics, blogger Nawsheen Rumjaun analyzes how people tend to perceive women's choice of dress in political environments:
the number of powerful women is increasing, but being a woman in politics is still tough.
The clothes they choose constitute a weapon to establish their authority in this mans world.
In politics, there is no pre-set dress-code but an unspoken rule that men should wear a suit, and women should have a decent outfit.
Those who cross the fine line between what is judged decent, and what is not, are at risk of being blamed because of their attire.
The length of the neckline
Ana Paula received 51,739 votes, making her the fifth most voted legislator in her state.
In an interview for Universa, a local website that covers women's issues, she commented on the attacks: The participation of women in society is so tiny that a neckline can become a huge issue, she said.
She also posted a video on her Facebook page responding to the offenses.
The comments on that video, however, were also packed with insults.
A user named Vitor said:
With all due respect, but have you forgotten in what environment you will work in the next few days?
Formality, please.
Be respectful!
Parliamentary decorum.
Another user, a woman named Yelena Sier, received 252 replies to her comment in which she criticized the politician:
Geral não entende!!
No one goes to a hospital wearing a bikini, children do not go to school in pajamas, men do not go to buy bread in their underwear, no one has surgery wearing whatever clothes, no one goes to sweet fifiteen parties or a wedding in their pajamas, etc. every occasion requires an appropriate attire, in companies there are uniforms and so on, and everyone knows that.
The issue here is not about what a woman wears or doesn't wear, but that each place has an appropriate attire.
On a different post, Rosimere Furtado defended Ana Paula's right to dresses as she chooses:
Congratulations for raising this issue!
While a state representative in a highly-respectful dress persecutes educators and states that education does not need financial investment, you have started a discussion about the importance of women in politics, about femicide, about causes that are independent of color or attire.
In a world where the mind is misrepresented and sexuality is exarcebated, any cleavage is a subject of war!!
Ana Paula fired back at her attackers by reminding them of her curriculum: before she was elected to the state assembly, she had been twice elected mayor of the city of Bombinhas and left office with a 90 percent approval rate.
Ana Paula also posted on Facebook an interview in which she said: Women are in politics and society has to get used to them as they are.
There are much more important issues for the legislative assembly to discuss.
She also documented the attacks and said that she would sue the people who have harassed her.
She told another interviewer:
Vou continuar vestindo o que eu quero.
Não pretendo me violentar para agradar ninguém
I will continue to wear whatever I want.
I do not intend to abuse myself in order to please others.

Human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor is currently serving a ten-year jail sentence in the UAE.
Photo Credit: Martin Ennals Foundation, via Citizen Lab.
Emirati human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor has endured an open-ended hunger strike since approximately mid-March 2019.
His supporters say his health is rapidly deteriorating.
Security officials arrested Mansoor from his home on March 20, 2017 over comments he posted online.
In May 2018, he was convicted under the 2012 Cybercrime Law of insulting the status and prestige of the UAE and publishing false reports and information on social media to damage the UAE's relationship with its neighbouring countries.
A court sentenced him to ten years in jail and fined him 1,000,000 Emirati Dirhams (US $270,000).
Mansoor has been advocating for democratic reform and protection of human rights in his country and the region for more than a decade.
He is the 2015 laureate of the Martin Ennals Foundation, which supports human rights defenders who are at risk.
He is a member of the Human Rights Watch Middle East and North Africa Advisory Committee.
This is not Mansoor's first time behind bars.
In 2011, he and four other political activists were jailed in relation to their connections to UAEHewar.net, an online discussion forum run by Mansoor.
He also used the forum to publish a petition calling for democratic reforms in the UAE.
State officials used this as a basis for charging Mansoor with insulting UAE leaders.
He was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison, but was released on presidential pardon after serving only seven months.
Prior to his 2017 arrest, he campaigned online on behalf of jailed activists in the UAE and elsewhere in the region.
The day before his arrest, he tweeted his concern about the continuous and arbitrary detention of Emirati activist Osama al-Najjar, who remained in prison despite having completed his three-year jail sentence.
According to Human Rights Watch, he also signed a joint letter with other activists in the region calling on leaders at the Arab League summit in Jordan in March 2017 to release political prisoners in their countries.
In December 2018, the State Security Chamber of the Federal Supreme Court, whose verdicts are final, confirmed his ten-year sentence.
According to the Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR), Mansoor began the strike to protest poor prison conditions and his unfair trial:
Mansoor is believed to be currently held in Al-Sadr prison in Abu Dhabi, where he is kept in isolation.
A source told GCHR that he is being held in terrible conditions in a cell with no bed, no water and no access to a shower.
His health has deteriorated greatly and he is in bad shape.
Human rights groups expressed concerns about the activist's health, calling on the UAE authorities to set him free.
Ahmed Mansoor is risking his health to call attention to his deeply unjust imprisonment simply because he advocated for the kind of tolerant, progressive society the UAE claims to be, said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
UAE authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Mansoor so that he can continue to serve as a voice for justice in a region desperately in need of it, she added.
The International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE called on the authorities to treat Mansoor in accordance with international human rights standards and to allow international rights groups to visit him in prison:
We reiterate our call for the immediate and unconditional release of Ahmed Mansoor.
Pending this, we urge the Emirati authorities to treat him in line with the UNs Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which guarantees the provision of medical care and sanitary prison conditions.
To ensure this, it is imperative that international NGOs be allowed access to al-Sadr prison to visit Mansoor.

The woman's jirga councils are taking place in provinces across Afghanistan.
Photos used with permission from Afghan Women for Peace.
In the coming months, Afghanistan will host its first-ever national-level all-women council, where thousands are coming together to remind the government and the Taliban that a long-awaited peace is impossible without their voice.
Over the past decades of war, women in Afghanistan have experienced shocking oppression that has deepened their social isolation and made them politically cautious.
Anti-women policies at state level peaked under the Taliban, who took power in the mid-1990s before they were ousted by a U.S.-led invasion.
The woman's jirga councils are taking place in provinces across Afghanistan.

That invasion led to gains in universal education, but women remain plagued by insecurity and the threat of violence.
Quotas for female representation in the legislature have not fundamentally changed the male-dominated nature of Afghan political culture.
Now, a resurgent Taliban's appearance at negotiating tables in Moscow and Doha has put even these qualified achievements under threat.
The group remains steadfast in its non-recognition both of women's role in the public space and the Afghan government, with whom it has not yet held direct talks.
Presently the Taliban prefers to speak to Washington, Moscow and select groups of Afghan politicians.
The group has said its position on women's rights is in line with that of Afghanistan's main religion, Islam and remains hostile to gender equality activism.

Being heard
In the meantime, Afghan women and womens rights activists from all walks of life came together and established Afghan Women for Peace, a 15,000 plus movement with members come from all 34 provinces.
The movement began six months ago as a shared initiative of the Afghan Womens Network, Ministry of Women Affairs, High Peace Council, and the Office of the First Lady of Afghanistan.
15,000 women across the country came together in 34 gatherings, one in each province, to raise their voices & discuss what peace means in their own community, what are their expectations & what are the costs of peace.
Afghan Women for Peace (@AfgWomen4Peace) February 20, 2019
In every province, Afghan Women for Peace brought together university students and female governmental employees, as well as literate and illiterate women looking to contribute.
Together they have shared their demands and thoughts on peace.
The woman's jirga councils are taking place in provinces across Afghanistan.

The organizers have spoken about the role of women in the government and in society, and shared ways to have a positive impact on society and make their voices heard by local and national authorities.
The first aim is to create a national consensus that Afghan women shouldn't be forgotten.
Women need to take part in the peace talks and share their demands and expectations for the future of the county.

Conferences have already been held in a number of provinces including Panjshir, Khost, Parwan, Baghlan, Ghazni, and Logar.
Conferences will continue in 28 other provinces over coming weeks.
What follows are the highlights  of the conference Khost province:
Peace should begin from the frontier provinces
Khost province is the economic and political corridor of Afghanistan
People at the district level should be included in the peace process
Engaging people who are in touch with the families of insurgents is crucial
If social justice is in place and laws implemented, peace will come
God and the prophet ( PBUH), and the people all want peace
Women and girls should be allowed to go to school
Female literacy should be increased so that children are brought up properly.
Todays women are aware and religious scholars should not undermine the importance of womens roles
Sharia dictates about women need to be interpreted properly
Peace begins in the family, then in the community, and then reaches the government
Peace means accepting one another and supporting each others positive actions
At the conclusion of every conference, participants approve such a resolution about the priorities and problems facing local women.
While no date has yet been set for the national-level jirga (tribal council), the event promises to bring together the work of all the provincial level groups.
Work at the provincial level is important.
Whilst there are women representatives in the parliament in Kabul, women governors are very rare, as is female representation in other important.
For many women in the frontier provinces, these jirgas have been a first-ever opportunity to participate in the political process and have their voices heard.
Women in Ghazni stated:
Peace does not mean just an end to the war, and no country can be successful in its national programs without the participation of women; therefore women must have a role in the social and political peace process.

João Lourenço, President of Angola.

An interview given by the President of Angola João Lourenço to RTP, Portugals public television channel, in which he stated that there was no hunger in his country, caused some outrage among citizens.
During the 30-minute interview broadcast on 4 March, the Portuguese journalist of RTP África referred to a UNICEF report which stated people were dying of hunger in Angola.
Lourenço then rejected the existence of starvation in the country, while admitting that there was malnutrition.
He said:
Our struggle is to reduce the rates of poverty, owing to the long years of armed conflict.
Today there is a supply of food in Angola, one cannot say that today there is [serious] hunger in Angola, it is a question of some malnutrition.
President João Lourenço said this just before the visit to Angola of Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, and a few days before a Catholic priest and human rights activist criticized the death of Angolans from hunger in a region suffering from drought.
The activist Manuel Mapanda, better known as Dago Nível, questioned the Presidents comments:
How is the gentleman going to say that hunger does not exist in Angola?
Did he not read the criticism of Father Jacinto Wacussanga about the death of an Angolan from hunger?
Does it mean that in Gambos and Curoca there is now no hunger?
As soon as Jlo [João Lourenço] assumed the presidency the majority of Angolans got basic essential goods, and hunger was eliminated?
During the unfortunate interview, the Angolan head of state also made clear his intention to combat corruption, which is part of the party's electoral programme:
Ninguém pode garantir que daqui para a frente não haverá corrupção e, que não haverá corruptos, mas que não ficarão impunes tal como sempre foi.
Não haverá mais intocáveis, segundo João Lourenço.
Esse tempo ficou para trás.
Nobody can guarantee that from this moment onwards there will be no corruption and that there will be no corrupt people, but that they will not remain unpunished.
There will be no more untouchables, according to João Lourenço.
That time is behind us.
In 2018, the Regional Forum for University Development (FORDU), a civic association in the field of education headquartered in southern Angola, produced a documentary (with no online version) entitled Angola, a country at risk.
It highlights the high number of people searching for food in bins, both in the urban centre of Huambo province, the documentary focus, and in the countrys capital Luanda.

On JM.
We need to recognize that there are still many people in Angola living at the margins of society, a problem that will be difficult to resolve if there is not a promotion of credible programs of social inclusion, where it is held accountable.
And not with this birth of a new elite of crooks who didnt get away with it before, who take advantage of the opening now where the main protagonist and financier of the nation is J.Lourenço.
Look at what the main challenges are right in front of your eyes, to overcome problems in the areas of health, education, housing, etc., which should at least already be showing some signs even if slight, but nothing can be seen

A Screenshot of ICT Minister Idah Nantaba who survived the assassination attempt, via YouTube video.
On March 24, 2019, news broke that Ugandan Information and Communications Technology Minister of State Hon. Idah Nantaba had survived an assassination attempt.
Ugandan police shot and killed one of her assailants in the small town of Nagojje, 53 kilometers east of the capital Kampala.
Over the last five years, numerous cases of assassinations of high-profile political, religious or military people have led to few concrete convictions or clear reports.
Ugandan citizens were, therefore, relieved to hear that the police had taken swift action.
However, a more complicated story has emerged regarding mistaken identity. Here's what happened:
Nantaba called the police to inform them that two men on a motorbike had been trailing her for more than 40 kilometers.
Police swung into action and intercepted two men on a motorbike near the Nagojje Trading center.
Ronald Ssebulime, 40, a single father of four, was a driving a regular motorcycle and carried a passenger behind him.
Police mistook the two men as Nantaba's assailants.
A chase ensued and Ssebulime hit a hump.
He and his passenger fell off the bike and the two fled on foot. Police fired shots in the air and Ssebulime eventually surrendered.
The passenger fled.
Ssebulime pleaded innocent, but police handcuffed and threw him into a police vehicle.
They drove for a short distance and then said the order had changed before they shot and killed him, according to several eyewitnesses who spoke with NTV Uganda.
One eyewitness said:
[Ssebulime] was picked up from the patrol van [already in] handcuffs and shot.
Another said:
The policeman took two steps back and shot him twice.
Botched investigation
In the confusion that followed, police tweeted that the shooting was justified because the men riding on the motorbike refused to surrender:
Several shots were fired in their direction, to cause them to surrender, but all in vain.
In the process, Sebbulime Ronald a resident of Nakabugo Village, Nakabugo Parish, Pakiso Sub County, and Busiro County in Wakiso District was shot dead during the pursuit.
Uganda Police Force (@PoliceUg) March 24, 2019
They added that a second suspect disappeared and fear he is armed and dangerous, although police could not confirm this.
Police is still searching the area with canine dogs for the second suspect, who is feared armed and dangerous.
We want to inform the public that the Minister, despite the scare is very safe and was not attacked at any stage as alleged in the media.
Police spokesman Fred Enanga said that the minister, witnesses and police officers involved in the pursuit would give statements while they continue to investigate Ssebulime's phone records as well as registration papers belonging to his motorbike.
Irene Nakazibwe, sister of the deceased, insists her brother was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
According to Nakazibwe, Ssebulime was, in fact, heading to St. Andrews Secondary School to visit two of his children studying senior one and senior three classes, in an interview with NTV.
They had spoken earlier in the day about the visit.
Ssebulime lost his wife back in 2012 and has been taking care of his four children as a single father.
It is unclear why he tried to run from the police when he had a National ID card and a driving permit.
Nakazibwe tells her story on NTV Uganda:
On March 27, 2019, the police finally admitted that Ssebulime was mistakenly identified and wrongfully murdered by officers and sent sympathies to the family of the deceased.
They also confirmed that Ssebulime was unarmed and only carried a bag full of soda and food intended for his children.

Boda-boda paranoia
The death of Ssebulime has stirred mixed emotions among those who use boda-boda, or motorcycle taxi, as a popular form of affordable transport.
At least five high profile murders involving military chiefs, members of parliament, religious leaders have occurred in the last three years  all performed by hitmen riding on motorbikes.
This has put both boda-boda drivers and high-level officials on high alert.
Twitter user Ganda Gannyana thinks the reason Ssebulime was killed without substantial proof of intentions to assassinate the minister stems from directives following the murder of Member of Parliament Hon. Ibrahim Abiriga.
President Yoweri Museveni said that if a leader suspects someone is trailing them with bad intentions, they should sort that person out:
It was a stupid directive from @KagutaMuseveni that if you only suspect anyone trailing you, sort them out first and quick and the rest we sort later.
Now see!?
An innocent #SsebulimeRonald has been slain.
Shot in handcuffs; thats cold blood
GandaGannyana (@IAmSegawa) March 26, 2019
Twitter user Kyeyune Moses contemplates the confusion surrounding the circumstances of Ssebulime's death:
The story of Ronald Ssebulime is bigger than meets the eyes.
Different accounts of who shot the suspected assassin and how the he was killed.
But most touching is the tell of his kids now at school.
They lost their mother, their dad is now gone.
Will justice prevail?
pic.twitter.com/0Q0fVS8v4Z
KYEYUNE W. MOSES (@moskyeyune) March 25, 2019
Twitter user Angelo Peter is furious that the police failed to produce any evidence that Ssebulime was dangerous before they shot and killed him:
When @PoliceUg wanted to pin BobiWine for treason they produced guns they found in his hotel room in less than 24hrs.
But they can't produce and show us the gun Ronald ssebulime had before they shot him dead after arrest.
In a press briefing, Nantaba narrates her story and questions who might have given the order to murder Ssebulime.
She suggests the whole scenario could have been orchestrated as a cover-up by masterminds of high profile assassinations   and still believes Ssebulime may have been involved in her assassination attempt:
The masterminds of these assassinations that have been happening in this country and according to what we see will still continue because [Ssebulime] was the one who was supposed to be a witness but the primary witness has been killed!

Edward Lowassa was a long-time ruling party CCM member until he was banned from running for president and joined opposition party CHADEMA.
Recently, he bounced back to CCM.
Screenshot via KTN News Kenya on YouTube.
October 18, 2015.
In Tanzania, high-profile opposition party members have defected to the ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, or the Party of the Revolution, casting a shadow on multi-party politics in the East African nation.
Most defectors come from the leading opposition party, Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo, or CHADEMA, the Democracy and Development party. Four CHADEMA members of parliament, 75 councilors and several village chairmen have joined CCM in the last few years.
The Tanzania Constitution Forum has called for a constitutional amendment to bar defections. The aim is to avoid unnecessary costs the government incurs in organizing frequent by-elections, said TCF chairman Hebron Mwakagenda, according to the East African.
The National Electoral Commission has conducted several by-elections at a high cost that yielded below 50 percent voter turnouts.
Campaigns have created fear and lack of trust among citizens.
The case of Edward Lowassa
On March 1, 2019, retired prime minister Edward Lowassa, member of the central committee of CHADEMA, bounced back to CCM, his longtime party, after defecting from it four years ago.
At a brief public ceremony, CCM chairman and Tanzanian President John Pombe Magufuli warmly welcomed  Lowassa:
Mr. Lowassa has shown himself to be a true gentleman.
We are taught to forgive and our aim is to build a new, united Tanzania with no political conflicts.
Lowassa confirmed that he is back home and there is no reason now for him to be in opposition.
Lowassa is one of few groomed by one of the earliest parties, the Tanganyika African National Union party, or TANU, formed before Tanzania's independence from Britain in 1961, and later, CCMs youth wing during the days of a single-party system.

Under the auspices of CCM, Lowassa served as MP for the Monduli district for 25 years and held ministerial responsibilities in parliament over four decades.
In 2008, while serving as prime minister under then-President Jakaya Kikwete, Lowassa was forced to resign after being implicated in a fraud scandal.
Lowassa moved to CHADEMA on August 4, 2015, just before the general election, after the CCM banned him from running as a presidential candidate.
He condemned CCM and its leaders as dictators, undemocratic and greedy power mongers.
CHADEMA then nominated Lowassa as a presidential candidate under UKAWA, a coalition of opposition parties.
In the 2015 general election, Lowassa obtained 6 million votes, around 40 percent, against CCMs Magufuli, who got 8.8 million votes or nearly 60 percent.
With Lowassas political influence, opposition parties, CHADEMA earned 70 seats in parliament compared to 48 in 2010, while the Civic United Front (CUF), also a member of UKAWA, earned 45 seats compared to 36.
Welcomed or lured back?
Lowassas return to the ruling party sparked both praise and ridicule from politicians and prominent political analysts.
CCM spokesman Humphrey Polepole congratulated Lowassa for his bold move to return to his longtime party:
To come back to apologize is a great wisdom and humility.
Others have argued that high defection rates are not good for national politics. 
Magdalena Sakaya, CUF deputy secretary general for mainland Tanzania, said the move is bad for democracy, and signals a conspiracy to kill the opposition, she added.
Dr. Adolf Mihanjo, head of the faculty of philosophy and religious studies at the University of Dar es Salaam, termed defectors as people who lack ideology and only seek leadership positions:
People have started feeling that defectors are being bribed  this is dangerous.
Likewise, CUF deputy secretary general for the islands of Zanzibar, Nassoro Mazrui, expressed pessimism with Tanzanias political future, saying corruption has engulfed multi-party politics.
CHADEMA chairperson Freeman Mbowe believes that defectors are being lured by CCM as a way of muzzling the opposition.
However, Maulid Mtulia and Godwin Mollel, two defectors who joined CCM last year, said they made the switch out of satisfaction with Magufulis performance.
Opposition party leader Zitto Kabwe, of the ACT-Wazalendo party and MP for Kigoma Urban, rejected their claims, calling them empty reasons without grounds and backings.
Dr. Richard Mbunda, a political science professor at the University of Dar es Salaam, cautioned that it is hard to regain legitimacy once it's gone.
Defections create self-disenfranchisement which can be disastrous: The government could slip as a democracy which could then lead to civil disobedience and illegitimate governance, he observed.
Squeezed civic space for opposition political parties
Tanzania legalized multi-party democracy in 1992 under Article 3 (1) of the constitution.
In a multi-party democracy, political parties play a fundamental role in providing stability and peace needed for peaceful political transitions.
However, the current government has imposed a series of restrictions that limit the power of opposition parties, such as limitations on political rallies and live-broadcasting parliamentary sessions.
In February, new amendments to the Political Parties Act were passed that further limit opposition politics.
Since Magufuli assumed power in 2015, there's been a continuous squeeze on civic, political and social spaces through various bills and legislation to limit freedom of expression online and in the streets.
Read more: An owl refuses to leave Tanzanian parliament.
What does it all mean?
Politicians  including national party leaders  are only allowed to hold rallies within their constituencies.
Violators face arrest and prosecution.
ACTs Kabwe was ordered to report to the regional police commander of the southern region of Lindi for conducting a political rally out of his constituency.
Kawe district MP Halima Mdee was arrested after speaking to her voters for the reason of conducting a meeting without permission.
Given the current state of Tanzania multi-party politics with defections of heavyweight opposition party members like Lowassa, multi-party politics struggle to thrive.
Since its beginning, though, the hope was for the scope of democracy to expand.

Mauritanian authorities arrested two bloggers, Abderrahmane Weddady and Cheikh Ould Jiddou, for reporting on corruption.
Weddady and Jiddou were arrested on March 22, after they appeared before Mauritanias Economic Crimes Unit to respond to a summons.
Both had investigated and reported on allegations of corruption involving the countrys president, Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz.
Prior to their arrests, they both wrote on Facebook about the alleged ties of Ould Abdel Aziz to a US $2 billion bank account in Dubai.
According to media reports, Emirati authorities had frozen the account at the request of the US Department of the Treasury, in its fight against money laundering.
Weddady wrote on his Facebook page that police questioned him about his sources and asked why he did not wait for the state to investigate the matter.
He answered that the news of the frozen assets was reported online and by foreign media, and that he has no faith in a serious investigation into any crime involving the president and those around him.
In early March, both bloggers were summoned and questioned by the unit about their writings on the alleged assets.
Authorities confiscated their passports and national ID cards, and then released them that same day.
Then on March 22, police arrested the two men after the public prosecutor's office concluded that the reports were untrue and pledged to investigate and prosecute those who disseminated them to harm the country, its institutions, its citizens and its judicial and financial systems.
The two bloggers stand accused of spreading false accusations against Ould Abdel Aziz under Article 348 of Mauritanias Penal Code.
They risk between six months to five years in jail each.
They remain in jail pending trial.
In an interview with Global Voices via WhatsApp, Nasser Wedaddy, the brother of Abderrahmane Weddady and a Global Voices community member, said that prosecutors have failed to present actual evidence against Abderrahmane and Ould Jiddou.
He also noted that their lawyers have found no actual evidence on file for the case.
He said: The prosecutor alleges that the evidence was lost.
It's his euphemism for we don't have any evidence to charge them, and we made it all up.
Since 2016, Abderrahmane Weddady had also been reporting and writing about a real estate scam, in which a man with alleged ties to the presidents family, fraudulently acquired ownership of houses of thousands of Mauritania to resell them, his brother Nasser Weddady said.
Jiddou also wrote about the scam on his Facebook page, his wife told Human Rights Watch.
Nasser Wedaddy also commented on this work:
My brother's 39-month investigation into the country's biggest ponzi scheme since its independence has been credited by many as a service to society.
He managed to uncover a swindle that ended up costing over 700 families their homes and savings.
He even uncovered how the current President is protecting and benefiting from the scam.
Freedom of expression is tightly restricted in Mauritania and the authorities often use criminal defamation laws to silence human rights activists, bloggers and journalists who speak out against the regime or expose government wrongdoing.
In a statement to Global Voices, the family of Abderrahmane Weddady demanded that both men be released and all charges against them dropped:
We demand the immediate and unconditional release of both Abderrahmane Weddady and Cheikh Ould Jiddou.
And the formal dismissal of any legal procedures against them, and a formal apology from the Mauritanian government for this gross and arbitrary subversion of the legal system to persecute political opponents.

Osama al-Najjar remains in detention, despite completing his jail sentence two years ago.

Emirati activist Osama al-Najjar remains in unlawful detention, despite having completed his three-year jail sentence more than two years ago.
Al-Najjar was arrested in March 2014 for posting tweets denouncing that his father had been tortured in prison, and calling for his release and that of other prisoners of conscience in the Emirates.
Osama's father, Hussain Al-Najjar, is one of 94 Emirati activists who were prosecuted en masse in 2013 for calling for political reform in the Emirates on charges related to harming State Security.
He is currently serving 11 years in prison.
In November 2014, the State Security Chamber of the Federal Supreme Court, whose verdicts cannot be appealed, sentenced Osama to three years in jail under the country's cybercrime law on a number of charges that include instigating hatred against the state and designing and running a website [with] satirical and defaming ideas and information.
He was due to be released on 17 March, 2017, but at the request of public prosecution, the court deemed him a threat to national security and extended his detention without specifying for how long.
Two year later, Osama remains behind bars, with no end to his detention in sight.
In a recent statement marking the anniversary of the end of his official sentence, the International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE said:
As there is no trial proceeding this form of detention, those transferred to such facilities can be held indefinitely with the government  rather than the judiciary  handing down punishment.
This type of administrative detention grossly violates international standards of due process.
Although he was not convicted of a terrorist offence, Osama is being held at a counselling centre at al-Razeen prison under the country's counter-terrorism law.
Emirati authorities claim that the purpose of these facilities is to offer guidance to those considered to be a threat against the state.
However, rights groups say that authorities are using counter-terrorism and these so-called counselling centres as a pretext to indefinitely extend the detention of prisoners of conscience.

Six students were detained on Tuesday, March 12, in Kirundo province in northeast Burundi for scribbling on pictures of President Pierre Nkurunziza in five textbooks.
The students were accused of insulting the head of state.
The National Federation of Associations Engaged in Children's Welfare in Burundi (FENADEB) reported that another student, 13, had been immediately released because he was a minor under the age of 15.
Three students were reportedly provisionally released on Friday, March 15, but, the remaining three were kept in custody.
The girls, aged 15 to 17, if found guilty, risk up to five years in prison for insulting the president.
Iwacu newspaper reported that families affected were deeply distressed.
Scribbling [on the presidents picture] is a punishable offense under the Burundian law, according to a Reuters report.
However, the age of the offenders may serve as a mitigating circumstance in these students trial.
As a teacher anonymously noted, the textbooks had not been checked for several years and are often shared by students, so it is difficult to know who marked them.
A similar episode occurred in 2016, following the controversy over the presidents third term, where high school students scribbled on textbook pictures of Nkurunziza.
Authorities took this as a serious insult and expelled hundreds of students from various schools across the country.
Eleven students were charged with insulting the head of state and threatening state security, although they were reportedly later cleared.
These actions were highly criticized.
Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, issued a statement on June 29, 2016:
I am dismayed by continuing reports of the suspension and arrest of schoolchildren and students for having scribbled on pictures of the president in textbooks.
Nkurunziza, the eternal supreme guide

Pierre Nkurunziza has been president of Burundi since 2005.
In 2015, he was controversially nominated by his party for a third term in office.
In March last year, Nkurunziza was named eternal supreme guide by his political party, the National Council for the Defense of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD).
Evariste Ndayishimiye, CNDD-FDDs secretary general explained why that title was conferred on Nkurunziza:
He is our leader.
Therefore in our party no one is comparable to him.
He is our parent; he is the one who advises us.
That is why I ask all our members to respect that because a home without the man (its head) can be overlooked by anybody.
For us, we have the best.
While the CNDD-FDD downplayed the title, Nkurunzizas reinforced status as the eternal supreme guide has made it difficult for anyone to disagree with his choices, including his move to change the two-term limit enshrined in the countrys constitution.
This reflects a centralization of power in the ruling party around Nkurunziza and supporters, and of the partys control of state institutions.
Scribblers in solidarity
Netizens have taken to scribbling on pictures of President Nkurunziza in protest through two hashtags: #Nkurunziza and #Burundi:
Burundians online are scribbling in protest, doodling on pictures of President Nkurunziza in reaction to the arrest of three school girls who were detained for drawing over the picture of the President on their school books.

Crackdown on criticism
Burundi's government has become increasingly sensitive to criticism since 2015, after a failed coup, clashes with rebel groups, criticisms of rights abuses, sanctions, economic hardships and a refugee crisis.
Nkurunzizas third term bid was opposed by the European Union, and the United Nations, who demanded a restoration of stability before elections.
Faced with these challenges, a siege mentality hardened and authorities clamped down more harshly on perceived threats.
The Human Rights Watch May 2018 special report discovered that Burundian state security forces, intelligence services, and members of the ruling partys youth league, the Imbonerakure, carried out brutal, targeted attacks on opponents or suspected opponents, human rights activists, and journalists, killing an estimated 1,700 people and forcibly disappearing, raping, torturing, beating, arbitrarily detaining, and intimidating countless others.
This has led to a refugee crisis that has seen Burundians fleeing particularly to Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda.
While thousands have returned, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recorded over 347,000 total Burundian refugees in February 2019 
UNHCR asserts:
[P]olitical unrest in Burundi took a deadly turn in 2015 after the president announced plans to seek a third term.
Street protests led to violent clashes, and hundreds of thousands fled to nearby countries in search of safety.
Earlier this month, Burundi closed the United Nations human rights office after 23 years, saying it was no longer needed.
The government was incensed with former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, who described Nkurunzizas Burundi as one of the most prolific slaughterhouses of humans in recent times in February 2018.
Media outlet closures, harassment of opponents, and clampdowns on NGOs and restrictions in political space for alternative narratives and arguments.
For example, rights activist Germain Rukiki who documented acts of torture committed by Nkurunzizas regime was sentenced to 32 years in jail in 2018 for participation in an insurrectional movement, undermining state security and rebellion.
Rukiki's trial was also marred by irregularities and came weeks before the controversial constitutional referendum.
The scribbling affair is also indicative of the governments increasingly conservative, moralizing approach, including mandatory marriages for cohabiting non-married couples in 2017, clampdowns on prostitution and begging.

Voting in progress during Nigeria's presidential election on March 28, 2015, in Abuja, Nigeria.

Nigeria will hold a presidential election on February 16, 2019, and all eyes are on this election as a test to prove the strength of Nigeria's democratic norms, values and unity.
This year, there are five main candidates in the race out of 73 total presidential candidates.
Two major contenders include the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari (All Progressive Congress) and the opposition candidate and former Vice President Atiku Abubakar (Peoples Democratic Party).
The other three candidates, Obiageli Ezekwesili, Kingsley Moghalu and Omoyole Sowore, have been termed the third force because they lack political experience but still present significant competition.
Amid the cacophony of electoral campaigns and the attendant passion from supporters  both online and offline  here are the key issues that may get lost in the noise.
Read more: Meet Nigeria's presidential candidates of 2019
Old and the strongman syndrome
Nigeria's two major contenders, Buhari, 76, and Atiku, 72, both have long histories of political engagement in Nigeria, leaving many to question their health and longevity as presidential hopefuls.
With the end of longtime rulers like South African President Jacob Zuma, 76, and Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, 94, who was forced out of power after 37 years as president, it has felt like an end to regimes led by the old and strong men in Africa.
But this hope has not lasted. Paul Biya, 84, was re-elected as president of Cameroon, making him the oldest political leader in sub-Saharan Africa.
The health of Nigerias leaders became a major political consideration after late President Umaru Musa YarAdua died in office on May 5, 2010.
YarAdua's illness and continued absence created a power vacuum because he did not hand it over to his deputy, Goodluck Jonathan, before he traveled abroad for treatment.
Incumbent President Buhari has made about ten trips to the United Kingdom for medical treatment of an undisclosed ailment.
He has spent more than 170 days in London on official medical leave since becoming president in 2015, according to the New York Times.
Can younger candidates stand a better chance?
This year, there are 10 candidates under the age of 40 and 16 candidates between the ages of 45-49.
But younger candidates may not fare well because Nigerias long history of military rule has embedded a culture of political actors who have both the clout and wealth to fund party politics and this takes time and connections to cultivate.
Buhari and Abubakar both have strong political bases.
Buhari has a loyal following in the northern part of the country, while Abubakar is perceived as widely accepted across different tribes and religions in the country.
Their ages do not appear to be a factor in garnering support and loyalty.
Ethnicity and religion
Nigeria is what's known as an ethnic fault line state  ethnicity and religion have long played a central role in elections and general politics.
The 2015 elections showed that the two major contestants received bloc votes from their various states and geopolitical zones, according to an article in the Journal of African Elections.
Also, ethnic sentiments were used to appeal to voters.
Ethnocentric hate speech surged both online and offline, before and after the 2015 presidential elections.
Similarly, in 2017, some Nigerian writers raised alarm over the vile ethnic hate speech that almost consumed the nation.
Former President Goodluck Jonathan lost in the polls over his failure to handle the Islamic militant group Boko Haram's bombings that rattled the nation and caused widespread insecurity.
Boko Haram's abduction of schoolgirls in Chibok led to a global outcry of #BringBackOurGirls when it was clear to citizens that the government was not doing enough to intervene.
Buhari and Abubakar will both rely on ethnic alliances to win votes.
Buhari, a northerner (Fulani/Muslim), has retained Yemi Osibanjo as his vice-presidential candidate in order to garner votes from the southwestern (Yoruba/Christian) part of the country.
Abubakar, a northerner (Fulani/Muslim) has picked his vice-presidential candidate from the southeastern (Igbo/Christian) part of the country.
Because Buhari and Abubakar are from the same ethnoreligious group, tensions may not be as high as they were in 2015 elections when Jonathan Goodluck, a southern minority Ijaw Christian, ran against Buhari.
Free speech and press freedom
Buhari's administration has been accused of major human rights violations and many hashtags have trended on social media in 2018 calling for the release of detained netizens and journalists.
On March 17, 2016, Nigerian journalist Yomi Olomofe was brutally assaulted and detained by Nigerian police in an attack against free speech.
Nigerian journalist Daniel Elombah and his brother, Timothy Elombah, were arrested on New Year's Day 2017 for a story they did not even write.
In August that year, Nigerian trader Joe Fortemose Chinakwe was arrested by for naming his pet dog Buhari.
Jones Abiri, publisher of Weekly Source, was arrested on July 21, 2016, by state security (DSS) agents at his office in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State.
#FreeJonesAbiri trended for several days on Twitter until Abiri was released on August 15, 2018, after a two-year detention.
#FreeSamuelOgundipe trended when Nigerian journalist Samuel Ogundipe was detained for three days by Nigerias Special Tactical Squad after refusing to name his sources for a story concerning the forceful prevention of lawmakers by security agents from entering the Nigerian National Assembly in early August 2018.
Deji Adeyanju, a political activist and member of the opposition party, was re-arrested in December 2018 and has been in detention since then due to a fresh petition.
Buhari has openly expressed his aversion to a free press and freedom of speech.
In an address to lawyers last year, he stated that the rule of law must be subject to the supremacy of the nations security and national interest.
On the other hand, Abubakar has promised to run an inclusive governance structure that will harness Nigeria's diversity and uphold a just and fair environment where the rights of all citizens are protected by a transparent government.
Only time will tell how these issues will unfold throughout the election period and beyond.

Article 68
The Great Mosque of Mecca, considered the holiest city in Islam.
Photo by Wikimedia user Basil D Soufi [CC BY-SA 3.0].When Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was killed last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, it cast a long shadow on the exercise of free speech for journalists from Saudi Arabia and across the Arab region.
The resulting political fallout also shook some of the most powerful institutions and voices in Islam.
After the circumstances of Khashoggi's disappearance and death came to light, multiple world leaders openly accused Saudi crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman of ordering the journalist's murder.
In what appeared to be a response to these accusations, the Imam of the Grand mosque in Mecca delivered a Friday sermon on October 19 in which he exalted Bin Salman, the Kingdom's de facto ruler.
Sheikh Abdulrahman al-Sudais lauded the modernizing reforms of Bin Salman and denounced attacks against these blessed lands in his sermon, which was pre-approved by Saudi authorities.
He went on to conclude that it [was] the solemn duty of all Muslims to support and obey the king and the faithful crown prince, the protectors and guardians of the holy sites and Islam.
Responding in a opinion piece for the New York Times, UCLA School of Law professor Khaled M. Abou El Fadl said the sermon had desecrated and defiled the podium of the prophet.
By using the Grand Mosque to whitewash acts of despotism and oppression, he wrote, Prince Mohammed has placed the very legitimacy of the Saudi control and guardianship of the holy places of Mecca and Medina in question.
Saudi Arabia's long history of politics in religion
With its theocratic system of governance, this is not uncommon in the ultraconservative kingdom.
In fact, Saudi leaders have long used religion as a tool of political power since the Kingdom's inception.
Saudi Arabia is home to Islams two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina.
Every year, millions of Muslims from around the world travel to Mecca to perform Hajj or pilgrimage, one of Islam's five pillars.
This has allowed the Saudi government to claim a special form of religious legitimacy in Islam.
The Kingdom has exploited this legitimacy to gain and maintain political power.
When the first Saudi state was established in 1744, Muhammad ibn Saud, emir of the small oasis town of Diriya, made a pact with religious leader and theologian Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab.
Abd al-Wahhab started an ultraconservative religious movement (today known as Wahhabism) based on an austere interpretation of Quran and prophetic traditions.
Fanack, an independent media and analysis site focused on the MENA region, explains that the union was intended to create an Islamic realm ruled by a strict interpretation of Islam.
This first Saudi state collapsed decades later, and a second state was established in 1824, only to collapse again in 1891.
In 1924 and 1925, the Ibn-Saud family invaded Mecca and Medina (Islams two holiest cities) respectively, with the help of Wahhabi fighters.
In 1932, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was established.
Ever since, Saudi rulers have continued to use religion to serve their political interests.
Voices challenging official religious discourse silenced
Today, the kingdom's history is at the top of mind for many Saudis as they grapple with rising levels of repression under the leadership of Mohammad Bin Salman.
Religious clerics are enlisted to treat those who denounce rights violations or call for reform as enemies of Islam, and state authorities continue to deploy religious discourse to serve the political interests of rulers.
In January 2019, Saudi Minister of Islamic Affairs Abdullatif Ibn Abdulaziz Al-Sheikh condemned the Arab uprisings of 2011 and 2012, describing them as poisonous and destructive to the Arab and Muslim human.
In an implicit reference to criticism targeted at the kingdom after Khashoggi's murder, the Minister denounced what he described as unjust attacks from the enemies of Islam and accused Muslims who are critical of the kingdom and its policies of spreading sedition, bringing discord, and inciting against their rulers and leaders.
Reflecting on the link between Wahhabism and political oppression, Saudi human rights activist Yahya Assiri, who lives in exile in London, tweeted on January 13
Oppression is a comprehensive system, and [in our country] it is enabled by religion.
When Ibn Saud and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab allied, Saudi Arabia and Wahhabism grew as a malignant twin.
Our country will not survive unless we get rid of the Saudi Wahhabi oppression.
As we have said this, others, with a good intention, have said that Wahhabism is a religious movement, while it is purely political
But the voices of people like Assiri are silenced in Saudi Arabia.
Another such voice is that of Abdullah Al-Hamid, one of the founders of the now-dissolved Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), who is currently behind bars.
Al-Hamid is serving eleven years in prison for his human rights activities, on charges that include breaking allegiance to and disobeying the ruler, and inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations.
He was convicted in 2013 by the infamous Specialized Criminal Court, established to try terror-related cases but often used to go after human rights activists.
Rights groups reported that Al-Hamid began a hunger strike on 17 February.
In a statement attributed to him and published by the MBS MeToo human rights platform, Al-Hamid announced that hes demanding the release of imprisoned human rights activists and political prisoners.
Abdullah Al-Hamid.
Photo from his Goodreads account.
In addition to his human rights activism, Al-Hamid is a poet and an academic.
In his writings, he has used Islamic texts and traditions to call for democratic reforms, advocate for human rights, and to critique the religious institutions that enable repression in Saudi Arabia such as the Council of Senior Scholars, the kingdoms highest religious body which advises the king on religious matters.
He once accused the Council of serving to support those who steal the peoples money, dignity and freedom and of playing a role in harming citizenship, plurality, tolerance and producing violence and extremism.
He also has advocated for a modern religious discourse that embraces a consultative rule and he opposed what he described as the common religious discourse in the kingdom which calls for prayer behind a unjust Imameven if he violated [one's] freedom, justice and equality.
Crackdown on independent clerics
While silencing those who challenge the government's official discourse, Saudi Arabia has also taken a hard line against clerics who are not sufficiently supportive of the Crown Prince's policies and actions.
Saudi clerics Sheikh Salman Al-Awda, Ali Al-Omari and Sheikh Awad Al-Qarni were all arrested in September 2017 on various charges that include their alleged ties to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Rights groups say the charges were brought on because the clerics did not vocally support the severance of diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar by Saudi Arabia and its allies.
And all three may face the death penalty.
At 62, Sheikh Salman Al-Awda is a prominent cleric with a massive social media following, not only in Saudi Arabia but across the Arab region.
The combined number of his followers on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube is more than 22 million.
He previously expressed support for the Arab uprisings of 2011 and called for democratic reforms in the kingdom and the region.
Amnesty International and other human rights groups linked his arrest to a tweet posted on 8 September, in which he reacted to news reports of a potential reconciliation between the nations.
In the second part of the tweet, he wrote: May God harmonize between their hearts for what is good for their people.
Ali Al-Omari is a religious scholar and the chairman of 4Shbab, a youth-focused Islamic TV channel.
In contrast to others, he was not vocal on political issues in the Kingdom.
He even once tweeted in support of the Kingdoms leaders, and posted a tweet praying for Bin Salmans success when he was appointed crown prince back in June 2017.
Sheikh Awad Al-Qarni faces a number of accusations that include supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, outlawed in Saudi Arabia, and slandering the Kingdom, its policies and its systems.
Several other clerics are also currently behind bars in Saudi Arabia.
Some have called for democratic reforms in the kingdom, like Al-Awda, while others voiced opposition to Bin Salmans policies or social reforms.
Others like al-Omari previously expressed support to Saudi rulers and the Crown Prince.
What these cases confirm is that under Bin Salmans de facto-rule, silence is no longer enough.
Beyond a mandate to stamp out independent voices  the words of anyone who is not writing in service of the Kingdom's leadership or political agenda  clerics must go the extra mile and outwardly praise the Crown Prince and Saudi leadership.
The opinions and ideologies of those prisoners of conscience currently behind bars in Saudi Arabia, including womens rights defenders, human rights defenders, Shia protesters and religious clerics, may vary.
But under the de facto rule of Bin Salman, these individuals are all subject to injustices at the hands of Saudi authorities including arbitrary detention, solitary confinement, torture, and enforced disappearance.
To legitimise and whitewash these acts of oppression, Saudi rulers never hesitate to use religion as a cover-up.

Article 69
According to the Cuban government, 20,000 doctors attended 113 million Brazilians in the last five years.
Image: Agência Brasil, CC BY 3.0
Thousands of Brazilians could be left without healthcare as Cuba begins pulling out 8,400 doctors who have been stationed in the country's smallest and remotest towns for the past five years.
In an official statement dated November 14, Havana announced it will end its agreement with Brazil as a response to president-elect Jair Bolsonaro's public comments about the program, which it deemed threatening and depreciative.
On multiple occasions over the course of the presidential campaign, Bolsonaro has disputed the skills of the Cuban doctors and criticized the agreement's terms.
Launched in 2013 by former president Dilma Rousseff, the program Mais Médicos (More Doctors) sought to widen healthcare access in Brazil's most vulnerable towns, some of which never had a resident doctor before.
It opened thousands of job posts in those areas, offering salaries of around 3,500 dollars per month plus a stipend for housing and meals (for comparison, Brazil's minimum wage is currently around 300 dollars per month).
The program gave preference to Brazilian doctors, but after they've signed up for only six percent of the job openings, the remaining vacancies were filled by Cuban doctors who were brought in through a deal signed by Brazil's Ministry of Health and Havana and mediated by WHO's Pan American Health Organisation.
By the agreement's terms, Brazil doesn't hire the Cuban doctors directly: instead, it pays the Cuban government, who recruits, manages and compensates them as civil servants  with a salary that is around 25 percent of what Brazil would pay them had they been hired individually.

The deal met plenty of criticism since the first doctors began to arrive.
They were booed in airports by massive crowds and were called slaves in protests led by Brazilian medical associations.
Bolsonaro himself, at the time a congressman at the Chamber of Deputies, went to the Supreme Court demanding the program's suspension.
Both during his time as congressman and the presidential race, he repeatedly said that the program was slave work.
He's promised to send the doctors back to Cuba with the strike of a pen so that they could assist the the members of the Workers Party who will soon be sent to Guantanamo.
In a TV interview in July 2018, he said that no one has any proof of whether [the Cuban doctors] have any knowledge of medicine.
In its official pull out statement, Havana's said:
The Brazilian people  who made the More Doctors program a success, who trusted the Cuban doctors from the beginning, who appreciated the respectful, sensitive and professional treatment they received  will understand who is responsible for our doctors being unable to continue providing support in the country.
Bolsonaro responded on his social media channels that Havana simply didnt want to accept new terms: to relay the full salary back to its doctors and that they'd validate their medical diplomas in Brazil through an exam.
He called it an irresponsible decision by the Cuban dictatorship for disregarding the impact it would have on the lives of Brazilians.
As journalist Leonardo Sakamoto writes, this could lead to the first social crisis in Bolsonaros government, and one that's unfolding even before he takes office.
Cubans make up 45 percent of the More Doctors professionals.
Around 28 percent of Brazil's cities served by the program only count with one resident Cuban doctor.
Around 90 percent of the doctors working in indigenous areas in Brazil are Cubans.
Brazil problems, Cuban solutions
Five years ago, Brazil had a deficit of 54,000 doctors in its public health system.
The country had 1,8 doctors for every 1,000 inhabitants.
For comparison, that rate is currently of 2,5 in the United States and 7,5 in Cuba.
Small towns in Brazil have always struggled to attract medical professionals, who complain about the lack of infrastructure.
Brazil also doesn't train enough doctors to serve its 200-million population.
The small socialist nation, on the other hand, has doctors to spare.
Currently, Cuba has 50,000 health workers stationed in 67 countries.
Leasing of medical experts is Cuban's main export: they generate 11 billion US dollars in revenue to the state per year, more than tourism does.

Cuba has sent its first medical brigade abroad in 1963, after the independence war in Algeria.
Since then, according to a story by Radio Ambulante, almost 500,000 Cuban physicians have worked in Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
Over the years, a few Cubans have told the Brazilian press that they felt exploited.
Some have joined lawsuits against both governments as well as the WHO.
Others have reported threats made by their government.
However, many said in a podcast by Radio Ambulante that, even with Havana's retention of 75 percent of the wages, they don't think the salary is unfair.
The results
A study by the Federal University of Minas Gerais, which interviewed 14 thousand patients in 700 cities one year after More Doctors began, revealed a high level of satisfaction with the program: 85 percent said that healthcare in their regions were better or a lot better.
The participants highlighted poor infrastructure and the lack of medicines as unresolved problems.
Another study from Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV) shows that the program helped the government to reduce a third of its expenses with hospitalizations.
Débora Mazetto, one of the economists who led the study, told BBC Brazil:
There has been an improvement on the quality of the services offered to the population.
Can you imagine a community that never had a doctor?
With the rising numbers of appointments in areas that were complete unassisted before, it's now possible to identify and treat diseases faster, avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations.
What next?
Since November 14, over 200 doctors have already returned to Cuba.
The Pan American Health Organization expects that all of them will have returned by December 12.
In many public clinics, people have found themselves without medical care this past week or were told that they'd only have a doctor available once a week from now on.
Although the Brazilian government claims that 92 percent of the spots left vacant by the Cubans have already been filled, newspaper Folha de S. Paulo said this number might not mean much at the end of the day:
In 2017, the Health Ministry opened a call to select Brazilians to More Doctors.
In total, 6,285 applied to 2,320 openings, but only 1,626 showed up to work.
Around 30 percent left their jobs before completing one year on them.
As with many social programs in Brazil, More Doctors did have its gray areas, but it also dramatically changed public health in regions that were completely forgotten by the Brazilian state.
Perhaps the greatest challenge so far for the next government-elect is to learn from its mistakes and where it got it right.
How, and if, Bolsonaros government will ensure healthcare is available in those regions is still to be seen.

Human rights groups and activists are urging the Iraqi parliament to withdraw a controversial cybercrime bill that would greatly restrict freedom of expression online, if adopted.
The bill imposes long prison sentences for speech-related offences that are only vaguely defined in the text of the bill.
Article 3 prescribes a lifetime prison sentence and steep fines for those convicted of using computers and the internet to undermine the independence, the integrity and safety of the country, or its supreme economic, political, military, or security interests or to provoke sectarian strife, disturbing the security and public order, or harming the reputation of the country.
Articles 4 and 6 impose the same punishments for those convicted of promoting terrorist acts and ideas (Art.4) or publish[ing] or broadcast[ing] false or misleading facts with the intention of weakening confidence in the electronic financial system (Art.6.)
Earlier this year, the Gulf Centre for Human Rights warned:
Without a clear and explicit definition of terrorism, it would be easy to use the law to liquidate the resources of political opponents and other activists.
Internet-related rights are already on shaky ground in Iraq.
Last summer, authorities responded to protests denouncing corruption and dire living conditions in Basra and other cities by shutting down the internet.
If adopted, the bill will only make it harder for Iraqis to exercise their rights to communicate, speak freely and access information online.
Earlier this month, nine human rights groups including AccessNow, Amnesty International and the the Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights published a statement urging the Iraqi parliament to withdraw the bill:
the law will result in Internet users becoming fearful of exercising their fundamental rights and freedoms online, and will empty the right to freedom of expression of its substance.
The law would also have far-reaching effects on the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of information as well as the right to participation in public affairs in Iraq.
The parliament was scheduled to debate the bill on March 14, but it was later removed from the day's schedule.
On Twitter, the official account for the Iraqi Council of Representatives thanked those who contacted it to criticise some laws, but did not specify which laws.
Rights groups and activists welcomed this response, but they remain wary.
Small victory: Campaigning by human rights activists, journalists on #Iraq and local and Intl NGOs successfully removed the draft cybercrime law from @parliamentiqs schedule.
Next step, withdraw the draft law altogether!
It remains unclear if the parliament will introduce changes to the bill or when it will be scheduled for debate again.

No to corrupt dictatorship, a drawing by Tibyan Albasha.
Used with permission.
Since December 2018, protests in Sudan that sparked over the tripled price of bread have turned into nationwide protests against the nearly three-decade rule regime of Omar Al Bashir.
Finally, on Thursday, April 11, 2019, Bashir was forced to step down.
AL-BASHIR IS OUT, WE DID IT !!!
#Sudan
Bashir's government has used repressive tactics and measures to quell the protests.
More than 40 protesters have been killed, hundreds detained and tortured.
The brutal response did not stop women from placing themselves firmly at the heart of the protests.
There is no amount of beating or detention that could make us stop.
These women and many more like them, are leading the huge protests against Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir.#SudanProtests
Today in Sudan we walk for women.
Incarcerated women.
Revolutionary women.
Oppressed women.
Refugee women.
War torn women, raped, battered and beat women.
Women who are too loud and too brave for a country made for men.
They lead the march chanting a Zagrouda, an ululation commonly used by women in the Arab world to express celebration.
Zagrouda (or the womens chant) has become the calling code for every protest in the street.
When people hear these womens voices, they know its the revolution call and that its time to start their march.
During the month of March, women wore the traditional white thobe in support of the protests and women's rights.
Social media platforms filled with pictures of female protesters wearing the white robe, using the hashtag  #whitemarch (#_)
Happy International Womens Day.
Impact Hub Khartoum Family
Women who protest regularly face police brutality.
Authorities have fired tear gas and live ammunition and have even threatened with rape.
Women have also reportedly been beaten, their faces have been branded and their hair cut off inside detention centers.
Every day new footage of Sudanese women getting beaten and humiliated circulates on social media:
Excessive brutality against elderly and women by police force in Khartoum North
But the same hashtags are also used to show the bravery of women in Sudan.
#SupportSudan

#Sudan ese girls and women have shown bravery beyond belief during the #Sudanuprising.
This week, a photo and a video from the protests have gone viral.
A 22-year-old engineering and architecture student named Alaa Salah raised her right arm as she led the crowd in a chant called Thawra (Arabic for revolution).
The video and photo would end up going viral and Sudanese activists are now referring to her as Kandaka, the title given to Nubian queens of ancient Sudan.
Dont know her name, but this Woman in #Sudan is leading rallies, standing on car roofs, and pleading for change against autocratic Bashir.
Here she is singing Thawra (Revolution).
Illustrations shared on social networks transformed Salah into the Sudanese Statue of Liberty.
If one day I have a #daughter, I want her to be just like her #AlaaSalah 22 year old engineering and architecture student chanting and leading protest in #Khartoum she is now a symbol of #Sudanese #Revolution and became the voice of #WomenRevolutions #Sudan #WomenLove #Peace
From the streets to the screen
Behind the screen, Facebook groups once dominated by conversations about marriage and crushes are now used to expose police brutality.
The women in these groups disclose videos and pictures of abusive security forces.
When the identity is revealed, the agent concerned is often beaten up and chased out of town.
The impact of these groups is remarkable  many security agents are now hiding their faces.
The Sudanese authorities have tried to block social media in the country, but the women bypass the blockade by using Virtual Private Networks (VPN), which can hide a user's location.
A revolution is never complete without art:

Female painters, digital artists, and musicians have produced works of art to complement street protests.
They use art to honor the endurance of the people, especially women.
They make art to document the events and portraits of the victims and depict the reality of living under an oppressive system.
Women are front, left and center of the revolution.
When people started protesting, they were like, Women should stay at home.
But we were like  no said Islam Elbeiti a 24-year-old jazz bass player.
Fighting for women's rights in Sudan
On March 12, the emergency court of appeals in Sudan, amid pressure from families of the women who rallied outside the courthouse, scrapped the flogging punishment of nine female Sudanese protesters that were sentenced to 20 lashes and one month in prison for rioting.
Flogging is a common form of punishment particularly for women in Sudan  they risk flogging for crimes like indecent clothing or adultery.
In 2014, a woman was sentenced to death for marrying a non-Muslim, which is considered adultery.
In 2015, a woman was lashed 75 times for marrying a man without her father's consent.
In 2017, 24 women were arrested for wearing trousers, a violation of the country's strict Shari'a Law.
Sometimes the brutality goes beyond flogging: Many Sudanese women have been sentenced to death by stoning.
According to Reuters, Bashir defended his position on strict adherence to Shari'a law in Sudan in 2011:
We want to present a constitution that serves as a template to those around us.
And our template is clear, a 100 percent Islamic constitution, without communism or secularism or Western (influences).
The Sudanese Penal code, which is based on an interpretation of the Shari'a (Islamic Law) allows girls as young as 10 to get married, and states that a woman's rape by her husband cannot be qualified as such.
On top of that, women have to face morality laws that chain them and oppress them on a daily basis.
For this reason, Sudanese women are on the front lines of the protests, fighting for change.

Article 72
Cyclone Idai devastates Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africa with massive flooding, rocks, and mudslides.
Image of flooding in Mozambique, shared widely on social media.
Tropical Cyclone Idai has left a devastating trail of destruction and death after sweeping through Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe in Southern Africa.
At least 162 people have lost their lives so far in the devastating storm across region.
In Mozambique, the city of Beira has been nearly entirely wiped out.
At least 89 people have died in Zimbabwe alone, amid fears of a higher figure, in Manicaland's Chimanimani district, located 406 kilometers east of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, as homes and bridges were swept away by a tropical storm that began on Friday.
More than 300 people are missing according to the government.
The United Nations in Zimbabwe said that more than 8,000 people have been affected by the flooding in the eastern parts of the country.
Sadly lives have been lost and properties destroyed, United Nations Zimbabwe said in a tweet:
According to the government, Cyclone Idai hit the Ngangu Township are in Chimanimani the hardest where most lives were lost.
Over a hundred houses were damaged by falling mud and rocks.
The storm originated in the Indian Ocean and led to a torrential rainstorm which commenced in Mozambique on Thursday, with wind speeds of about 160 kilometers per hour, reportedly causing ocean waves of up to 9 meters high.
The police and military have been deployed to assist in the evacuation of victims.
Visibility, according to the Information ministry, has significantly improved and this will help airforce helicopters to evacuate more people.
Local government minister July Moyo said that bodies are currently being seen floating in rivers and nothing much can be done at the moment.
Roads, bridges and telephones are currently cut off and hundreds of homes destroyed.
Country director for the International Red Cross (IRC) Zimbabwe Paolo Cernuschi said the IRC teams in Zimbabwe are trying to reach communities affected by the cyclone but the infrastructure damage is severe and the teams couldn't reach Chimanimani or Chipinge.
Urgent road repairs in progress so we will try again in the morning, said Cernuschi.
The Zimbabwe government held an inter-ministerial committee on Sunday morning and subsequently set up 10 subcommittees to deal with hard-hit areas.
Committees will deal with areas related to food security, resource mobilization, safety and shelter, transport, water and sanitation among other critical areas.
An official with the Meteorological Services Department said that the cyclone has weakened greatly and shifted from eastern to northeastern areas of Zimbabwe.
Up to 200 millimeters of rainfall was recorded in Chipinge [located in eastern Zimbabwe], 118 millimeters north of Chipinge, and 102 millimeters in Buhera [southeastern Zimbabwe], said the official.
He warned that the eastern highlands of the country should still expect floods due to the torrential rains and advised the public to avoid traveling there.
Not much precipitation was expected on Monday, with light rainfall and better weather conditions expected to commence on Monday.
Recovery efforts will be long term and relief efforts are underway.

Article 73

Via YouTube.
The Democratic Republic of Congos constitutional court announced last month Felix Tshisekedi as the country's newly elected president, rejecting a legal challenge filed by runner-up Martin Fayulu who claims the vote was fraudulent.
The DR Congo held fiercely contested general elections in late December 2018 after the incumbent, President Joseph Kabila, who ruled for 18 years, was constitutionally barred from running for a third term.
The election was anticipated to be the DR Congos first democratic transfer of power in 59 years of independence, but has been mired in controversy since the December 30 vote.
Frontrunner Martin Fayulu of the Engagement for Citizenship and Development party.filed a court challenge claiming the votes to be rigged against him.
He and others believe a deal was made by Tshisekedi of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, or UDSP, and President Kabila of the ruling Common Front for Congo party, or FCC.
On January 19, 2019, the court rejected Fayulus request for failure to prove his assertions beyond a reasonable doubt.
According to the Independent National Electoral Commission, Tshisekedi received 38.5 percent of the vote while Martin Fayulu, of the Lamuka opposition alliance, obtained 34.7 percent and loyal hardliner Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary garnered 23.8 percent.
Voter participation was less than half at around 47.6 percent.
Following the announcement, celebrations commenced at party headquarters in Kinshasa, the capital.
Among several heads of state in Africa, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa congratulated Tshisekedi and the United Republic of Tanzania's President John Magufuli also tweeted his congratulations.
Despite initial disagreement among African Union members about the election outcome, the AU has welcomed Tshisekedi, who gave his maiden speech to the union on February 10 to warm reception.
But two months after the disputed elections, many fear that this transition of power was staged carefully to ensure that Kabila holds onto power through backstage agreements with Tshisekedi.
Who is Tshisekedi?
Félix Antoine Tshilombo Tshisekedi was born in Léopoldville on June 13, 1963.
His father, Etienne Tshisekedi, dominated Congolese politics as the founder of UDPS  the largest opposition party.
Due to his fathers opposition politics, the family was exiled internally to their home town, Kasai, and in the 1980s, 
Tshisekedi traveled with his father to Belgium, where he earned a diploma in accounting in 1987.
He earned several other degrees between 1991-2001 and worked in marketing.
While in Belgium, Tshisekedi turned to politics, like his father, and became the national secretary for external relations of the UDPS in 2008.
In November 2011, he planned to represent the city of Mbuji Mayi in Kasai but did not take his seat, citing a deceitful election.
His father was supposed to take on a leadership role as Kabila transitioned out of power, but upon his fathers death on February 1, 2017, son Felix Tshisekedi was elected to lead the UDPS, thrusting into him a powerful leadership role.
The people's soldier  opposition woes linger
Tshisekedis victory may bring peace to the DRC or explode into turmoil, depending on whether or not Fayulu, who firmly rejected the election results, can accept this transition of power.
Fayulu called the election results a constitutional coup detat and electoral swindle.
In a January 14 statement from the Roman Catholic Church, one of the few trusted institutions in DR Congo, they said:
The results of the presidential election published by [the electoral commission] do not match those collected by our observer mission.
It is no secret that you have elected me president, Fayulu announced to the public, considering himself the only legitimate president of DR Congo.
Fayulu has been involved in campaigns for multi-party democracy and organized protests to this effect in 2016 and 2017.
Francesca Bomboko, director of Berci International, a research and consulting group in DR Congo, told the BBC that Fayulu has often shown up at protests to oppose Kabila.
Fayulu has reportedly said that the Congolese call him [the] people's soldier.
When Fayulu was nominated as the joint opposition candidate for 2019,  Albert Moleka, Etienne Tshisekedi's former chief of staff, told the BBC that Fayulu could become the new Etienne Tshisekedi, saying hes the one who embodies the real opposition.
With the support of former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba and Moise Katumbi, the former governor of the mineral-rich Katanga province, Fayulu seems to be rising in influence and power in DR Congo politics.
With no full support from party ranks, Tshisekedis victory came as a surprise.
According to the International Crisis Group, the UDSP split into several factions, some of which rejected the transfer of leadership to Etienne's son Tshisekedi.
Felix Tshisekedi is also somewhat of a novice in the political arena.
Tshisekedi has been criticized for his lack of charisma and political experience in high office, drawing his political legitimacy from his father, according to Simon Allison of the Mail & Guardian.
On the other hand, Tshisekedi is more diplomatic, conciliatory and attentive to people, a member of the Congolese opposition said.
He has promised to build a nation of unity, peace and security.
Tshisekedi said on January 20 that the court's confirmation of his win was a victory for the entire country.
It is Congo that won.
I am engaged in a campaign to reconcile all Congolese.
Congo wont be of division, hatred or tribalism.
It will be a reconciled Congo, a strong Congo focusing on development, peace and security.
Patrick Litanga, a Ph.D. student at American University in Washington DC., speaking to Al Jazeera, observed that Tshiesekedis win may be the beginning of a new political landscape:
Felix Tshisekedi will be the first president in the Congolese political history since the time of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba to face a serious countervailing power.
We may be witnessing the genesis of political checks and balances.
DR Congos future hinged on difficult past
DR Congo gained independence in 1960.
Since then, citizens have been subjected to numerous human rights violations such as extrajudicial killings; torture, sexual and gender-based violence including rapes and abductions.
Uppsala Conflict Data Project concluded that Laurent Kabilas government saw the next three highest conflict death rates respectively, with 13,884 in 1998, 8,019 in 1999, and 7,537 in 2000.
Will the new epoch of Felix Tshisekedi government end the turmoil or stir up it?
Lets wait.

Article 74
Ahmed Hussein-Suale Divela [Image credit: Committee to Protect Journalists]One month after Ghanaian investigative journalist Ahmed Hussein-Suale Divela was shot dead in his car in Madina, Ghana, activists are calling for answers and insights into the circumstances of his gruesome death.
The group United Press for Development staged a peaceful solidarity walk in Accra in mid-February as a message to police that Divelas killers have not yet been identified or convicted.
They say that walks will continue until the group gets answers.
Divelas killing calls attention to press freedom in Ghana where violent killings of journalists are actually rare, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Yet, Kofi Asante, the groups organiser, says that his group recorded 31 journalists being murdered in Kumasi, some of them were killed in 2018 and the irony is Ghana has been accredited as the number one country in press freedom in Africa and 23rd in the world.
Who was Ahmed Hussein-Suale Divela?
Ahmed Hussein-Suale Divela worked with Tiger Eye Private Investigations, an investigative journalism outlet led by Anas Aremeyaw Anas.
Their unconventional and controversial approach to investigative journalism has exposed many high profile people across Africa.
Divela had recently contributed to investigative work that exposed Kwesi Nyantakyi, former president of Ghanas football association, also a former member of FIFAs General Council, accused of accepting a bribe of $65,000 USD.
FIFA's adjudicatory council gave Nyantakyi a lifetime ban from all football-related activities.
Anas announced the murder of Divela in a tweet that included an attached video showing Ghanaian parliament member Kennedy Agyapong speaking live on TV in May 2018:
In September 2018, Divela told the Committee to Protect Journalists via WhatsApp that some powerful figures in Ghana sought to harm him after an image of him was published on NET 2 TV station in May 2018 by Agyapong.
Since my image was published and [the] public was incited against me [] many people have attempted [to attack me].
These criminals after us are people who are [] associated with powers that be in Ghana and can do anything and get away with it.
Indeed, it [has] been hinted in some quarters that the very man who published [my image] said he was doing everything possible to quell [my] existence.
MPs words have power
Agyapong, a member of the ruling New Patriotic Party, has served as an MP for 19 years.
In his fight against corruption, Agyapong is known for making bribery allegations against corrupt political officials  especially those within his own party.
A debate ignited over whether or not Agyapongs remarks on live TV directed at Divela may have provoked his murder:
The boy is very dangerous.
He lives here in Madina.
If you meet him somewhere, break his ears.
If he ever comes to this premises [sic], I'm telling you, beat him.
Agyapong justified his actions and said his comments were not meant to provoke harm and referred to a skirmish. Divela allegedly once had with one of Agypongs staff members.
In another video, Agyapong suggests that Anas is actually a prime suspect in Divelas death.
He offered to pay a 100,000 Ghanaian Cedi reward (about 19,000 US dollars) for anyone who finds Divelas killers as proof that he did not call for his murder.
Agyapong left Ghana after police questioned him  he strongly denied that he was fleeing Ghana or that he has been identified as a suspect.
Six people have been arrested and released on bail in connection with Divelas murder.
Police stated arrests were based on reasonable suspicion.
However, their identities have not yet been released.
Dangerous journalism
Tiger Eyes Investigations had been receiving death threats for several years and was accused of using unethical techniques that violate journalism ethics.
While there is no evidence to show that Agyapong had any direct connection to Divela's killing, his words do have power and were spoken on a TV station owned by him.
A CPJ report reveals that in 2018, about 53 journalists throughout the world were killed, 34 of whom were targeted for murder in reprisal for their work.
Between 2016 and 2017, 102 journalists were killed as a result of their work.
Over one thousand journalists were murdered in the last decade (2006-2017) according to a report by UNESCO.
The high profile assassination of The Washington Post columnist, Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on October 2, 2018, by agents of the Saudi government drew global ire.
Awil Dihar Salad, a veteran journalist in Somalia, was killed in December 2018.
Salad fled Somalia in 2005, fearing he could be targeted, but later returned and was then murdered.
Earlier in July 2018, three Russian journalists were killed in the Central African Republic while investigating the activities of the so-called Wagner group, a group of private military contractors.
Engaging in investigative journalism can be like signing a death warrant.
Many African governments operate in opacity and they firmly resist attempts at exposure.
Considering the poor remuneration of journalists, it does not make sense for most journalists take this level of risk.
Yet, Divelas death is not forgotten and his work lives on.
Journalists and activists will keep walking until there is resolve.

A billboard shows Mozambique's president Filipe Nyusi.
Photo by Dércio Tsandzana, used with permission.
In October 2019, Mozambique will elect its next president and its Congress for the sixth time since 1994  and will elect provincial governors for the first time in its history.
Although the race hasn't officially begun, it is generally expected that the eternal rivals of Mozambican politics will compete: Frelimo, the ruling party since 1994, and the largest opposition party, Renamo.
It will be the first time Renamo will compete without its historic leader Afonso Dhlakama, who has led the party for over four decades.
Dhlakama died on May 3, 2018, following a heart attack.
Dhlakama will be remembered as the Renamo leader who signed the General Peace Agreements of 1992 with former President Joaquim Chissano, which set Mozambique on the path towards democracy.
To succeed him, Renamo has chosen Ossufo Momade after he was elected by a party congress held in June 2018 in Gorongosa, the Renamo base located in the central Sofala province.
He will probably be the Renamo candidate in October, and will likely compete with the current president, Frelimo's Filip Nyusi, and Daviz Simango  who presides another opposition party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM).
MDM was founded in 2009 and along with Renamo and Frelimo are the only parties that have representatives in the Assembly of the Republic or hold municipal offices.
Daviz Simango has run, and lost, two previous presidential elections.
The October vote will also happen amid a ceasefire signed in 2016 between an armed branch of Renamo and government forces, who have in recent years skirmished with each other in Mozambique's countryside.
In February 2019, the National Elections Commission (CNE) warned the public about the lack of financial resources to organize the nationwide poll.
Key dates
01/04  15/05: Voter registration
31/08 a 12/10: Campaign
15/10: Polling day
Perhaps most significantly of all, this is the first time Mozambicans will elect provincial governors.
Previously, they were nominated by the president.
The shift is the result of arduous and lengthy negotiations between  Renamo and the government.
While the President hasn't yet sanctioned the law that will provide for this change, it is widely believed he will do so.

Article 76
In his annual state of the union speech, Vladimir Putin promised Russians a faster, more reliable internet; it definitely won't be any freer, say experts.
On February 20, Vladimir Putin addressed the Russian parliament in his annual state of the union speech.
He pledged massive investments in social programs and civil infrastructure, notably the countys IT backbone:
This year we must adopt a master plan for developing the infrastructure of a digital economy, including telecommunications networks, as well as data storage and processing capacities.
Here we need to look ahead as well.
The task for the next few years is to provide universal access to high-speed internet and start using 5G communications networks.
Improving internet infrastructure and ensuring that all Russians are online may sound progressive.
But these developments will come about in an era of unprecedented online information control in Russia.
In February, two reports came out that noted a sharp, continuous downwards trend in online freedoms.
Indeed, it seems that while more Russians will have access to the internet, it will be an internet governed on the state's increasingly strict terms.
One study compiled by Agora, a human rights group, lays out the different ways the Russian authorities are clamping down on individual users, social networks and online media.
The most significant trend, Agora says, has been a wave of laws and regulations that force internet service providers and tech giants to police online content on the Russian government's behalf.
On more than one occasion, internet service providers have been forced to block access to websites for publishing information about court proceedings, or exposing government corruption.
In one high-profile case, providers were made to block access to the website of Alexey Navalny, a prominent opposition activist and anti-corruption campaigner.
Agora's report says:
The authorities are paving the way for blocking online services that they see as catalysts for mass protests, while attempting to present this crackdown as simply a requirement to follow national laws.
Delegating policing and censorship functions to private actors not only minimizes reputational damage, but also ensures more effective control and spending.
Agora also notes a sharp increase in restrictions on individual pieces of content: a total of 662,842 items were censored in 2018, in comparison to 115,706 in 2017.
This includes blocked websites and individual URLs, online news articles, social media posts deemed extremist or inflammatory etc.
In a rare instance of good news, one of the most infamous items of the Russian criminal code, Article 282 (Incitement of hatred or enmity, as well as abasement of human dignity,) responsible for the majority of prosecutions for online speech, was reined in by an amendment passed in December 2018.
This appears to have brought a decline in prosecutions related to online speech.
However, legal experts are skeptical about the possible liberalization of Russian laws.
Agoras report predicts that public prosecutors may shift towards using other, less severe articles in both the criminal and administrative codes to punish dissent.
This could enable them to silence individual users and organizations, while triggering less visible public backlash.
Agora also notes that western IT platforms are increasingly acquiescent towards the demands of the Russian authorities, a trend that Runet Echo covered previously.
Citing Google's Transparency Report, Agora says that in June 2018 Google satisfied 79 percent of all data removal requests from the Russian government, while only 62 percent of similar requests from the US authorities were complied with.
Google's report shows that requests for content removal from the Russian government multiplied by more than five-fold in six months in 2016 from 2,045 in June to 11,164 in December.
To Google's credit, it didn't comply with any of the 94 removal requests from the Russian government which it classifies under Government criticism.
Google also provides some examples of the content they're removing, and a significant part of is genuinely dangerous to the public: ads for illegal casinos scamming people out of their hard-earned rubles, violent racist propaganda, online drug markets selling dangerous substances etc.
But Google readily complied with requests for removal of activist videos calling for rallies against corruption  because these rallies were arbitrarily declared unsanctioned and thus in violation of a pointedly restrictive law aimed at stifling public dissent.
Twitter, Google and Facebook have all shown that they're willing to remove content or make it unavailable to Russian users upon receiving requests from the Russian authorities to comply with the local laws.
There is little indication that the companies take into consideration the exceedingly restrictive nature of some of these laws, or that they are weighing these requests against Russia's constitution.
Another report by the Internet Protection Society (OZI) is even darker in its predictions: its titled The New Year Pessimism, and it notes the longest and sharpest drop of its online freedom of speech index since the measurements began in 2016.
OZI lists seven events that impacted the index in January, all in a negative way: from new pieces of legislation to landmark cases, such as the prosecution of Yana Antonova, a pediatric surgeon in Krasnodar, who was targeted for sharing a video by Open Russia, an activist media outlet declared an undesirable organization.
Being associated with an undesirable organization  the government-mandated list also includes the National Endowment for Democracy and the Open Society Foundation  is an offence punishable by a law introduced in 2015 by a range of penalties, from a heavy fine to a prison term.
Sharing a Facebook video also counts as collaborating with an undesirable organization, which Antonova learned the hard way.
The OZI report also emphasized the potential damage of the Klishas bill, which came as part of the package of restrictive pieces of legislation currently reviewed by the Russian parliament.
Named after its author, senator Andrey Klishas, the bill aims to create a sovereign infrastructure for the Russian internet, ostensibly to shield it from foreign interference.
The other, an anti-fake news bill also co-authored by Klishas, is even more controversial and almost universally condemned by experts.
Yet both passed in the first reading thanks to the overwhelming majority that the ruling United Russia party holds in the parliament.
It seems that the Russian government is finally confident in its ability to control online activity  so confident that it can now offer internet access to all Russians, without fearing the consequences.

Article 77
The following post is originally written by Holmes Chan and published on Hong Kong Free Press on 21 of Feburary, 2019.
The edited version is republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement.
Singaporean activist Jolovan Wham has been handed a 16-day jail sentence for refusing to pay a fine for a public talk he hosted with Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong via Skype in 2016.
He is out on bail pending appeal.
Wham is an activist known for his campaigns promoting the rights of migrant workers, free speech in Singapore, and reform of the countrys laws on detention and the death penalty.
Last month, Wham was convicted of illegal assembly over a November 2016 forum he hosted on the topic of civil disobedience and social movements, which featured Joshua Wong and local media activists.
Wham was told by police that he needed a permit for Wong to speak, but he went ahead without one.
On 21 February, the court fined Wham S $2,000 (USD $1476) for organising a public assembly without a police permit.
He also received a fine of S $1,200 (USD $886) for failing to sign a police statement.
Singaporean media reported that Wham chose not to pay the fine, and that the court sentenced him to 16 days in prison for failure to pay the fine.
Aside from illegal assembly, Wham was also charged for refusing to sign his police witness statement.
He said at the time that he chose not to sign because he was not given a copy.
Wham intends to appeal the judges decision.
He has been released on a bail of S $8,000 (USD $5,906), according to media reports.
The forum in question was organised by Community Action Network, a non-governmental group concerned with freedom of expression in the city-state.
According to Wham, the police told him it was compulsory to get a work permit and police permit if any of the participating speakers were not from Singapore  even if they spoke remotely via video link.
After the event, Wham was questioned by police for 45 minutes.
He was finally charged in November 2017, but the case did not come before a judge until January 2019.
Joshua Wong told HKFP that Whams prosecution was an embarrassment and a terrible injustice, and that he deeply regretted the judgment.
Jolovan generously invited me to share and exchange my experience in Hong Kongs fight for freedom and justice with the Singaporean community  the irony is not missed here that Jolovan has become a subject of injustice as a result.
Id like to express my respect and admiration for Jolovans perseverance of his values, and my wish for the Singaporean people to one day be able to enjoy true freedom and democracy.
Stretching of the law
Singaporean journalist and Global Voices collaborator Kirsten Han, who was also a guest speaker at Whams forum, decried the sentence as outrageous.
[The forum] posed no threat to public order whatsoever, and the stretching of the law to declare a forum illegal simply because a non-Singaporean Skyped in shows how broad Singapores public order laws are, and how they can be used to restrict Singaporeans civil libertiesTheres no sentence that Id consider fair, because he should never have been charged.
Han also disputed the prosecutions account of events.
According to Channel NewsAsia, the prosecution argued in court that thousands were invited to the forum and 366 people indicated they were interested in attending.
However, Han said the event only had slightly more than 60 attendees and was pretty standard.
The venue wasnt that big anyway, she added.

Blogger Malele Paulo also known as King Faipopo.
Source: Facebook
Samoan police arrested Australia-based blogger Malele Paulo on 8 February while he was visiting the country to attend his mothers funeral.
Malele is a known critic of the government who writes under the pen name King Faipopo.
The police confirmed that Malele was arrested for making false statements with the intention of causing harm to a member of our Samoan communities reputation.
In August 2018, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi filed a defamation complaint against Malele, which appears to have set the stage for his arrest after he entered the country in early February.
He was released on bail on 9 February, and was able to attend his mothers funeral.
In 2013, Samoa withdrew libel from its criminal law as a media reform initiative.
But the change didn't last long.
At the end of 2017, the parliament of the Polynesian island nation unanimously voted to revive its criminal libel law after Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said it is needed to fight ghostwriters and troublemakers, despite opposition from media freedom advocates.
The Tuilaepa government said the law will be used against anonymous bloggers and Facebook users who spread lies and misinformation.
The prime minister cited this law in his complaint against Malele, whom he accused of posting false information about him and Samoan politics.
Malele reportedly wrote on his blog that Tuilaepa committed murder, corruption, theft, and gun smuggling.
Tuilaepa insisted that he is not against citizens expressing their views:
I am not prohibiting anyone from exercising their freedom of speech or freedom of expression but I take issue when the rights of the innocent, like myself are violated through lies and deceit.
This kind of lying and attacking members of the community through social media is what the law was designed to prevent.
After Tuilaepa filed the defamation complaint, his government sought the extradition of Malele from Australia.
A police statement concerning Malele's arrest also cautioned the public to avoid making defamatory statements on social media:
The damage that defamatory statements on social media outlets and cyber bullying has done to several members of the community is a matter that these laws are designed to address.
Where complaints are laid with the police, we will do our best to assist those being victimised on social media platforms by false statements.
Pacific Freedom Forum Chair Bernadette Carreon of Palau described Maleles arrest as an attack on freedom of speech:
Focus on fighting corruption, not freedom of speech.
New legislation, based on old criminal libel laws from colonial times, forces Samoa leaders to look backwards, not forwards.
Another critic of the government, blogger Ole Palemia, criticized the decision to arrest Malele:
What the people need to know and always remember is that corrupt PM Tuilaepa and all the politicians are public figures therefore they are subjected to public criticism  that's what you call democracy.
Maleles arrest has sparked intense debates in Samoa.
A news report surveyed the views of some citizens who expressed concern about the timing of the arrest while others agreed with the defamation case and urged critics to show respect to the countrys prime minister.
Malele is scheduled to appear before the court on 5 March.

The 2019 Nigerian presidential candidates [Collage by Nwachukwu Egbunike].Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, will hold presidential elections on February 16, 2019.
Although there are 73 presidential candidates, the race for Aso Rock  the seat of Nigeria's presidency  will be between two major contenders and candidates from the so-called third force, a group of hopefuls who are relatively new to Nigerian politics.
The two major Nigerian parties, All Progressive Congress and Peoples Democratic Party, will, of course, be fielding their candidates:
Muhammad Buhari, president of Nigeria.

Muhammadu Buhari
The incumbent candidate of the All Progressive Congress, Buhari won the 2011 presidential election after defeating former president Goodluck Jonathan.
Buhari's ascendance to power was based on his integrity and perceived ability to curb corruption and the Boko Haram militancy.
However, under his watch, Nigeria has witnessed continued insecurity with pastoral conflicts between herders and farmers as herders from the north move further south in search of arable lands.
Also, human rights have taken a nose drive in his administration, with impunity and corruption at the highest levels of government.

Atiku Abubakar
Abubakar is the former vice president and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party.
He has tried in the past to win presidential elections but has not been successful.
However, his campaign received a major boost with the reconciliation with his boss, former President Olusegun Obasanjo  who had described Buhari's administration as a failed government.
As vice president, Abubakar oversaw the privatization and sale of hundreds of loss-making and poorly managed public enterprises.
A few other presidential hopefuls to watch are:
Oby Ezekwesili [Image released by campaign organizers as media resource]
Obiageli [Oby] Ezekwesili
Ezekwesili, the only major female candidate in this year's race, served as the minister of solid minerals and later education during the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo between 1999 to 2007.
She was also former vice president of the Africa division of the World Bank from May 2007 to May 2012.
Ezekwesili has been at the forefront of the call to rescue about 200 school girls who were abducted by the Boko Haram militant Islamic group in 2014.
She is a co-founder of the #BringBackOurGirls (BBOG) Movement.
She is also the presidential flag-bearer of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria.

Kingsley Moghalu
Moghalu is a professor of international business and public policy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, USA.
Moghalu had previously worked in the United Nations from 1992 to 2008.
He was deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria from 2009 to 2014, where he led extensive reforms in the Nigerian banking system after the global financial crisis.
He is the candidate of the Young Progressive Party.

Sowore is the founder and publisher of SaharaReporters (SR), an investigative online newspaper.
SR has been described as Africa's Wikileaks.
This human rights activist is running under the banner of African Action Congress.
The race is on for Nigeria's future
Buhari and Abubakar are the major contenders in this race.
Both men have been constants in the political arena in Nigeria.
On the other hand, Ezekwesili, Moghalu, Sowore, the third force, are a  group making their first entry into the partisan political space.
Buhari will be running on the gains of his administration over the past three years and must contend with the fact that Nigeria was recently ranked as the poverty capital of the world.
The Punch newspaper described Buharis parochial appointments as unprecedented and has left the country deeply divided.
His fight against corruption appears selective and punitive.
The recent move to try the Chief Justice of the Federation  so close to the presidential election  was described by the Nigerian Bar Association as a pattern of consistent assault on the heads of the two independent arms of government by the Buhari administration.
Abubakar, on the other hand, is riding on the gains of multiple lucrative business interests.
However, he has an uphill task considering the power of incumbency of his major opponent.
Whoever wins the 2019 elections will face enormous challenges like the strengthening the economy, internal security, restructuring power and power devolution, and ethnoreligious politics.
Editor's note: An earlier version of this post stated that there are 35 presidential candidates and has been updated to reflect that there are 73 presidential candidates.

Eissa Muhamad, from Niger, has been stranded at the Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for two months now.
Photo by Eissa Muhamad, used with permission.
Eissa Muhamad, from Niger, says he has been stranded in the transit section of Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for more than two months, starting on November 6, 2018.
Muhamad, 24, was deported from Israel where he lived for eight years as a migrant.
I met Muhamad on December 12, 2018, at Bole International Airport while in transit in Addis Ababa.
Muhamad tells me he has been deported twice from Israel in 2018.
When he returned to Niger the first time, Muhamad's Israeli travel documents were still valid, so he turned around and booked another flight back to Israel.
When he arrived in Israel, authorities confiscated his travel documents and deported him again back to Niger.
When Muhamad returned to Niger the second time, authorities requested proof of citizenship but he failed to produce valid documents, either Israeli or Nigerien, to support his citizenship.
Muhamad remained in Nigerien custody for eight days before being deported back to Israel via Ethiopia on an Ethiopian Airlines flight.
When he arrived at Bole International Airport in Ethiopia, Ethiopian authorities, in collaboration with the Israeli government,  prevented him from boarding his connecting flight to Israel.
They informed him that Israel was not willing to accept him, and since then, he has been stranded inside the airport, stuck between Niger and Israel.
I slept on the chairs, sometimes I slept in the mosque, I didnt take [a] shower for two months because [the] airport [has] no place for a shower, I only wash my face, my hands and my legs, thats all.
Muhamad has attempted to contact the Niger embassy in Addis Ababa, but because he was not able to provide valid documents to prove his Niger citizenship, Muhamad says they were unable to assist him.
As of 2018, Israel currently has 34,000 African migrants who undertook perilous journeys to Israel in search of a better life.
But Israel claims many are economic migrants who have put a strain on the economy.
Opting to stay meant jail time and significantly fewer resettlement options.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the right-wing Likud party remain focused on targeting those deemed infiltrators.
Israel Democracy Institute study says 66 percent of Israelis support government policies to deport African immigrants.
Muhamad claims that he was legally living in Israel and worked in a factory, and told me the government took away his residency status and threw him out of the country.
Ethiopian authorities have not arrested Muhamad and have provided meals for him while staying at the airport.
Technically, Ethiopia is a signatory to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol as well as the 1969 Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, and nearly all refugees entering Ethiopia are granted asylum on a prima facie basis, but Muhamad told me he is not willing to apply for asylum in Ethiopia.
In this video interview, Muhamad explains to me what it has been like to stay trapped at the airport in Addis Ababa without a clear idea of the future:

Article 81
Screen capture from a video of the Russian Ambassador giving his speech by Africa Guinee TV on YouTube [in French]On January 9, 2019, Alexander Bregadze, the Russian Federation's ambassador to the Republic of Guinea, sent his New Year's compliments to Alpha Condé, president of the West African country.
He filmed the video greeting in Conakry, the capital, where his diplomatic office is located  and in his speech, broached a particularly sensitive subject  the possibility of Guineans changing the constitution to allow President Condé to seek a third term after his current tenure expires in 2020:
Depuis que la Guinée est devenue la Guinée dAlpha Condé, elle est vraiment en marche.
Monsieur le Président vous êtes un exemple phare pour la jeunesse guinéenne.
Malheureusement, le principe dalternance qui domine beaucoup de Constitutions dans le monde, mais pas toutes heureusement, impose la mentalité de revanche: Cest notre tour, maintenant cest nous qui devons diriger le pays
Mais les Constitutions ne sont pas ni dogme, ni Bible, ni Coran.
Since Guinea has become the Guinea of Alpha Condé, it is truly on the march.
Mr. President, you are a beacon to the youth of your country.
Unfortunately, the principle of political succession, which dominates many constitutions in the world, not all happily, entrenches an attitude of payback: It's our turn now, we must run the country
But constitutions are neither dogma, Bible, nor Quran.
Constitutions adapt themselves to reality, he continued in Condé's presence, making it clear that reality did not adapt itself to constitutions: Even for Christians, there's the New Testament and the Old.
According to the ambassador, all is well in Guinea.
And yet, the facts reflect another reality.
Teachers went on a general strike this year that lasted three months, unemployment is growing nationwide, and Guinea was found to be the chief country of origin for illegal migrants entering Europe in 2018, with a staggering statistic of 13,068 people.
Yet, the ambassador went on:
Sous nos yeux la Guinée devient le pays le plus électrifié de lAfrique.
Dune année à lautre,  on circule mieux sur les routes entre Conakry et les régions guinéennes.
Before our eyes, Guinea is becoming the most electrified country in Africa.
Year after year, the roads between Conakry and the regions are getting easier to drive.
In an article for the newspaper Vision Guinée, journalist Pathé Bah writes that Ousmane Kaba, a former strategic adviser of President Condé, acknowledged in a public intervention:
La Guinée est dans lobscurité, Il ny a pas délectricité dans notre pays.
Cest pourquoi, je me suis battu pour avoir largent pour construire Kaleta sur le Konkouré.
On se bat pour avoir beaucoup de barrages sur le Konkouré, parce que cela fait avancer le pays.
Guinea is in darkness.
There is no electricity in our country.
That is why I have fought for the money to build Kaleta [a hydroelectric power station] on the Konkouré [river].
We are fighting to get many reservoirs on the Konkouré, because it takes the country forward.
As for the country's economy, the finance minister estimates the level of growth at 5.8 percent for 2018, with an inflation rate of 8 percent.
The African Development Bank reckons that Guinea marked growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) of 6.6 percent in 2016 and 6.4 percent in 2017  but that didn't stop the ambassador from declaring exaggerated numbers to indicate growth:
Ces dernières années on a constaté la croissance entre 10,5% en 2016 et de 6 au 7% en 2018 avec le pronostic de 7% en 2019Connaissez-vous beaucoup de pays en Afrique qui font mieux ?
Over the last few years, we have seen an increase of between 10.5 percent in 2016, and from 6 to 7 per cent in 2018, with a forecast of 7 percent in 2019  Do you know many countries in Africa which are doing better?
The ambassador added road conditions to his litany of praise for the president.
However, Alimou Sow, an eminent Guinean blogger, shared a contradictory experience on his blog:
Je suis debout dès potron-minet pour affronter, en solitaire, le tronçon jugé le plus difficile, Conakry-Kindia  135 km que lon accomplissait, il y a quelques années, en un peu moins de deux heures montre en main.
Maintenant, il faut rajouter deux heures supplémentaires pour crapahuter sur la même distance devenue un parcours de rêve pour un rallye raid de type «Paris-Dakar», tant la route est en piteux état.
I've been up since daybreak to confront, alone, what is judged to be the most difficult stretch, Conakry-Kindia  135 kilometers, which one could complete, a few years ago, in a little under two hours by the stopwatch.
Now, you must add two more hours to crawl the same distance, turned into a dream route for an endurance rally à la Paris-Dakar, so perilous is the state of the road.
In 2016, members of the Guinea Bloggers Association launched a campaign to draw attention to the state of the country's roads, and show their exasperation via the hashtag #montronsnosroutes [let's show our roads].
The Guinea Bloggers Association will start a campaign to denounce the state of the road in Guinea.
The idea is to share a photo on social media with the #ShowOurRoads hashtag.

The Russian ambassador's speech has caused embarrassment to both civil society and the diplomatic community.
Guinea's opposition leader, Cellou Dalein Diallo, castigated the diplomat's attitude in these terms, quoted by Balla Yombouno in the newspaper Le Djely:
Il a été manipulé par Alpha Condé [le Président de la Guinée] lui-même.
Et nous savons quil est le représentant dune grande nation, dun grand pays qui a participé activement à la décolonisation du continent africain, et qui a eu une relation exemplaire avec la Guinée dans le respect du principe de non-ingérence dans les affaires intérieures [] Nous allons essayer aussi de saisir le gouvernement russe pour faire état de cette prise de position
He has been manipulated by Alpha Condé himself.
And we know that he is the representative of a great nation, a great country which actively participated in the decolonisation of the African continent, and which has had an exemplary relationship with Guinea in respect of the principle of non-interference in internal affairs [] We will be striving to contact the Russian government to press this position
Speaking on behalf of civil society activists, Gabriel Haba, president of the Citizen Action Brigade, expressed  indignation sparked by the ambassador's support; journalist Ibrahima Sory Barry posted about it for Aminata.com:
La question de lalternance est une question de souveraineté.
Et la souveraineté appartient au peuple.
Il nest pas du rôle dun ambassadeur de dicter à la Guinée sa destinée.
Cest de lingérence dans les affaires internes de notre pays.
The question of political succession is a question of sovereignty.
And sovereignty belongs to the people.
It is not part of an ambassador's role to dictate Guinea's fate.
It is an interference in our country's internal affairs.
The civil society organisation Cellule Balai Citoyen (Citizen's Sweep Up) published a press release, which read in part:
La Guinée vit sous le risque dun embrassement sans précèdent susceptible de découler dun forcing politico-social en faveur dun 3e mandat en violation de lactuelle constitution mais aussi de léthique dans la gouvernance démocratique.
Cette tentative qui se fait de plus en plus sentir peut être source dune violence politique aux graves violations de droits de lhomme dans notre pays qui peine encore à cicatriser le lourd passif dans cette matière, de lindépendance à nos jours.
Guinea is at risk of an unprecedented embarassment which is liable to unleash a sociopolitical impetus for a third term in violation of the current constitution and indeed, the ethics of democratic governance.
This increasingly palpable attempt could give rise to political violence with serious human rights violations in our country, which is still struggling to make good the heavy legacy of this kind from independence to our own time.
On Facebook, writer and commentator Ibrahim Marie Sanoh wrote:
C'est fort abstrus que ce soit un étranger qui doit saluer les prouesses du pouvoir guinéen et plaider à ce qu'il lui soit accordé d'autres années pour faire du pays le plus électrifié du contient le plus industriel du monde, tandis que le peuple qui l'a investi manifeste une cruelle indifférence et ne pipe mot.
It's pretty peculiar that it takes a foreigner to pay tribute to the Guinean regime's feats, and plead for it to be given more years to make the country the most electrified in the world's most industrial continent, while the people who have brought it to power manifest a cruel indifference and have nothing to say.
Meanwhile, the behaviour of other ambassadors attracted the attention of Guinean blogger Nouhou Baldé:
Cette déclaration est tellement grave que le silence des autres n'est pas à excuser si facilement.
D'autant que certains de ceux qui ont pris la parole par la suite (l'ambassadeur du Maroc, le représentant de la Banque mondiale) ont dit ne pas dire mieux que le russe.
Personne ne s'est désolidarisé de cette déclaration et aucune ambassade n'a publié un communiqué
This declaration is so serious that the silence of the rest can't so easily excuse it.
All the more so as some of those who have spoken up since (the Moroccan ambassador, the representative of the World Bank) have said the same as  that is to say, no better than  their Russian counterpart.
No one has disassociated themselves from this declaration and no embassy has published a communiqué
On January 14, security forces dispersed a demonstration outside the Russian embassy, which civil society organisations had organised in protest over the ambassador's comments.

Article 82
Olusegun Obasanjo, former President of Nigeria.
[Creative Commons (CC BY 2.0)/ Flickr, June 27, 2011.
]As Nigeria prepares for another presidential election in February, retired military generals turned politicians are key to understanding Nigeria's political space.
Nigeria has been ruled by either former generals or those who have their support since 1999 when democratic governance returned.
The recent public feud between former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari  both retired military dictators  has a great impact on next month's elections.
In a rare open letter to Buhari, Obasanjo has accused him of plans to rig the 2019 elections.
He wrote:
Democracy becomes a sham if elections are carried out by people who should be impartial and neutral umpires, but who show no integrity, acting with blatant partiality, duplicity and imbecility.
Obasanjo insisted that Buhari would not deliver free, fair, credible and peaceful elections and warned that what is happening under Buharis watch can be likened to what we witnessed under Gen. Sani Abacha.
In 1998, Sani Abacha, a military dictator, had called for general elections but it became obvious that Abacha had no intention of handing power over to civilians.
The five political parties at the time endorsed Abacha as their sole presidential candidate.
Now deceased, Abacha became infamous for his repression of human rights and corruption.
Obasanjo alleged that Buhari was towing the same path as Abacha in mad desperation.
Shehu Garba, the media assistant to President Buhari, dismissed Obasanjo's letter:
The elections starting in February will be free and fair as promised the nation and the international community by President Buhari.
Obasanjo, the letter writer?
Olusegun Obasanjo, former military head of state (1976-1979) and later Nigerias democratically elected president (1999-2007), has consistently criticized successive governments in Nigeria.
Last year, Obasanjo had advised Buhari not to seek re-election as president but to consider a deserved rest at this point in time and at this age.
This advice caused ripples in Nigeria because Obasanjo was a strong supporter of the Buharis candidacy during the 2015 presidential elections.
Prior, Obasanjo had scolded Goodluck Jonathan in a public letter written in 2013, Obasanjo accused Jonathan of driving the country to the precipice and allowing deceit, corruption and mutual distrust to tear at the fabric of the nation.
Ironically, Obasanjo had also supported Jonathan's election in 2011.
And in 2007, he promoted the election of Jonathan Goodluck's predecessor, Umaru Musa YarAdua.
However, Obasanjo went against YarAdua when the latter became sick and did not hand properly hand over power to Jonathan, his then deputy.

Retired generals never rest in Nigeria
Nigerias political landscape is held by retired generals or their cronies.
Obasanjo, for instance, has been instrumental in the emergence of Nigerian presidents from 2007 to 2015.
However, unlike civilians  YarAdua and Jonathan  who he promoted and also criticized, Buhari is somewhat different.
Although Obasanjo supported Buharis election in 2015, he cannot fully take the praise alone.
This is because Buharis ascendance to power was made possible by his allegiance with Bola Tinubus defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN).
Buharis Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) later merged with ACN, in February 2013, to form the All Progressive Congress (APC) .
In addition, Buhari a former military head of state (1983-1985) is a member of the club of retired generals who have dominated Nigerias political space.
Therefore, as harsh as Obasanjos reprimand might sound, a lot depends on the dynamics of the power block to which they both belong.
Obasanjo is not alone, however, in his criticism of Buhari.
Theophilus Danjuma, a retired general, had in March last year accused the Nigerian armed forces of aiding the ongoing killings in Nigeria.
Danjuma, a former chief of army staff and later minister of defense, chastised the military for taking sides in the pastoral/farmer crisis in the country, but especially in his home state of Taraba.
Similarly, Danjuma recently raised an alarm about plans to use the police and soldiers to manipulate the 2019 elections.
Similarly, in February last year, former military head of state Ibrahim Babangida publicly advised President Buhari not to stand for re-election, arguing that 21st century Nigeria needs to tap younger generations.
He believes that there comes a time in the life of a nation when personal ambition should not override national interest.
But it may be a while before Nigeria gets a civilian president who has no links or backing from the retired generals club.

Ten years ago, on Saturday 7 February 2009, Victoria experienced catastrophic bushfires which killed 173 people, injuring more than four hundred and destroying over two thousand homes.
Seven people died later as the result of their injuries.
During the week of the 2019 anniversary, Victorians have remembered Black Saturday, with mainstream media presenting many personal stories of the fires.
ABC Melbourne, the local arm of the national broadcaster, commemorated the victims by sharing stories from survivors.
Others have shared their memories online.
On her blog, The small Adventurer, Indya recounts losing her home and shares the impact of the fires on her life since that day:
Ten entire years, and I still dont think one single day has passed without me mentioning  or at least thinking about  the fires.
[] I am also still really, really nervous around things like ovens, stoves, heaters, and even lighters.
As a baker, you can imagine how difficult having those fears is when Im going to take something out of the oven, and suddenly something doesnt move the way I expect it to or something like that, and I instantly freeze up and freak out.
[] Tomorrow I will be thinking of all those who had it much worse than me, and hoping that the people who are still alive and lost so much more are doing okay.
But, I will also be thinking about myself, and allowing myself to feel whatever I happen to feel, because my feelings are valid too.
My fear and sadness is valid too, and always have been, it just took me a while to realise it.
Dianne McNamara posted only the second tweet on this account:

Melbourne lawyer Georgia was fifteen at the time.
She summed up the feelings of many:

10 years since those same fires took so many lives, so many homes, so many animals and so many livelihoods.

Many people are connecting the Black Saturday tragedy to current extreme weather conditions that are wreaking havoc in other parts of the country.
Another natural disaster with extraordinary flooding has hit Northern Queensland following record rainfall.

Elizabeth Donoghue took the photo at the top of this story from a road that many people describe as a death trap, a road that I have always avoided till now.
But it was worth a hairy drive!
She posted it two months after the fires on Flickr:
Now that everyone knows that this beautiful country that was so burnt in February is not really destroyed, but is just doing what nature intended, and is regenerating, as nature intended, let me show you this amazing landscape.
It gives some idea of the scale of the fires; and it also shows, for me, the folds and rhythms of the land beneath the vegetation.
i took this from a road that many people describe as a death trap, a road that I have always avoided till now.
But it was worth a hairy drive!
Finally, Adrian Cutts reflected on the growth of social media since Black Saturday:
Incidentally, it will also be 10 years tomorrow, since most of Australia found out what Twitter was.
Black Saturday was the turning point for Twitter in this country, from when it was perceived to be a untested medium, to becoming a part of our lives.

Survivors who lost relatives and houses rest outside following the June 5 attack in the village of Naunde in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique.
Photo by Borges Nhamire, used with permission.
Mozambican journalist Amade Abubacar was arrested on January 5, while reporting on a trend of violent attacks on small villages in Mozambique's province of Cabo Delgado.
Located in northern Mozambique, Cabo Delgado is rich with natural resources, such as ruby, charcoal and natural gas, found in the Rovuma Basin.
Some observers say the group coordinating the attacks intends to begin trafficking these resources.
Since October 2017, multiple attacks have been carried out in different districts of Cabo Delgado by what appears to be the same rogue group.
Many media have reported on the attacks, but state officials have been unwilling to comment on or confirm evidence in these cases.
In 2018, more than one hundred people were prosecuted together in relation to these crimes.
Their trial is expected to end this year.
#FreeAmade: campaign to release Mozambican journalist
Amade Aoubacar works with the Mozambican Social Communication Institute and as a journalist with news site Zitamar and the local radio station, Nacedje.
The journalist was arrested and detained by Mozambican federal police on January 5, while photographing survivors of an attack in Cabo Delgado.
Amade was then taken to a military quarter of the Defense Forces of Mozambique in the district of Mueda, despite not being a member of the armed forces.
After a few weeks, he was transferred to a civilian prison to legalize his detention in Pemba, capital of Cabo Delgado .
After he arrived at the civilian prison, Amade contacted the Mozambican Order of Lawyers and reported having experienced torture at the hands of Mozambican armed forces, who he says beat him and deprived him of food.
Many individuals and media freedom groups have spoken out in his Abubacar's defense, saying that his arrest and detention have threatened the exercise of free expression.
The Media Institute of Southern Africa, which monitors media rights and activities in the region, spoke out strongly against Amade's detention:
Abubacars prolonged detention by the military is a violation of his rights as well as his arrest under unconfirmed charges.
The Mozambican government is setting a bad precedent in the violation of free expression and access to information in the region.
Amnesty International also released a statement:
Amade Abubacar é um respeitado jornalista que estava a gravar depoimentos de pessoas que fugiram de ataques mortais em Cabo Delgado quando foi preso pela polícia.
Esta é a mais recente demonstração de desprezo pela liberdade de expressão e liberdade de imprensa por parte das autoridades moçambicanas, que veem os jornalistas como uma ameaça e os tratam como criminosos.
Amade Abubacar is a respected journalist who was recording testimony from people who fled deadly attacks in Cabo Delgado when he was arrested by police.
This is the latest demonstration of contempt coming from Mozambican authorities and directed at freedom of expression and freedom of the press [authorities] view journalists as a threat and [thus they] are treated as criminals.
The campaign has also spread on Twitter, with the creation of hashtags like #FreeAmade to advocate for the liberation of Amade.
@UNHumanRights demands immediate release of journalist #AmadeAbubacar
Arbitrary detention was no longer enough, they had to torture him, make him sleep with handcuffs at the military base without give him food.
This is terrible.

On January 29, when the Tanzanian parliament (Bunge) assembled in Dodoma for its first session of 2019, an owl flew into the building, perched on the ceiling and observed the assembly from above.
The incident drew national attention and provoked questions from social media users and newspapers.
What could the presence of an owl in parliament mean?

Je, Bundi anapoonekana inaashiria nini?

The owl has been spotted twice inside the halls of parliament in the city of Dodoma.
What does it seem to signal?
Bad omen?
the regional weekly, The East African, proposed.
The British blogger and media analyst, Ben Taylor, went further:
The owl that entered parliament signalled the coming death of Tanzanian democracy?

Tanzanian cartoonist, Samuel Mwamkinga (Joune), later illustrated the incident with a reference to the British term a group of owls based on the Greek perception that owls are wise (illustration used with permission).
The owl is, however, seen as an omen of death and misfortune in Tanzania.
And  the owl was determined to stay in Bunge, according to The Citizen:
The owl, a nocturnal bird, could not leave  despite several attempts by parliament officials to evict it.
Owls are not unusual in Tanzania, and neither is Tanzanians inclination toward superstition.
A 2010 survey found that 93 percent of Tanzanians believe in witchcraft.
No ordinary parliament session
For this particular session, the presence of the owl offered a symbolism, even for the nonsuperstitious, which was too stark to be ignored.
On the agenda for Tanzanias first parliamentary session of 2019 were the proposed amendments of the Political Parties Act, which has followed a months-long, intense debate in an increasingly unstable political climate.
Tanzania made history in 1992 as one of the first countries in Africa to establish a multiparty system, which allowed opposition parties.
The Political Parties Act (here with proposed amendments) was also introduced in 1992 and has been amended over time with the latest amendment in 2009.
With the owl perching above the assembly, Tanzanian parliamentarians agreed to amend the act  a step that critics regard as a serious weakening of the multiparty system in Tanzania, and thus also democracy.
In short, the renewal of the act provides more authority to the government-appointed registrar to not only deregister political parties but also to issue punishments in the form of imprisonment if a political party, for instance, carries out civic education related to voter registration and other politically-motivated activities, according to Reuters.
Several media quoted Zitto Kabwe, leader of the opposition party ACT-Wazalendo, who already back in August 2017 criticized the proposed amendment of the act, predicting it may undermine political rights.
Kabwe then compared it to the Media Services Bill 2016, which set the free and independent media back.
Now, Kabwe calls attention to the inherent contradiction caused by the amendment of the Political Parties Act:
You cant have a constitution that allows freedom of association then give someone powers to revoke that freedom of association.

Dying democracy?
Tanzania's declining democracy under the rule of President Magufuli has been a recurring topic in the media, including a popular topic for satire.
On January 30, Fatma Karume, Chair Woman of Tanganyika Law Society, tweeted a cartoon by the Kenyan cartoonist Gado (September 22, 2017) pointing to the role of Tanzanias President Magufuli and the death of democracy:
Good morning everyone.
Have a lovely day.

In recent years, Tanzania has turned increasingly authoritarian in its legislation, resulting in less space for critical political opponents and independent media.
Now, critics say the amended Political Parties Act will make it more difficult to practice politics that are critical of the president and Chama Cha Mapinduzi (The Party of the Revolution), in power since independence in 1961.
Opposition is essential for a vibrant democracy.
A strong opposition will check up on government and challenge it.
If there is no opposition, diversity of citizen needs are unlikely to be represented well.
In 15 tweets, doctoral student Rachel McLellan walked readers through possible consequences of the new act, and characterizes a situation where a critical opposition will find itself cornered:
So most of your ways of convincing voters are gone.
What do you do if you're an opp party?
Go back to the drawing board and come up with new strategies, right?
Well, this bill introduces unprecedented oversight powers to the Parties Registrar that make that v difficult 5/n
Rachael McLellan (@RachaelMcLellan) January 29, 2019
Superstitious or not  those critical of Tanzania's authoritarian turn found some wicked relief in the presence of the owl and the unsuccessful attempts to chase it away.
The owl remained.
Speaker of the Parliament, Job Ndugai, tried to tweak traditional belief with a pragmatic explanation:
Honourable Members of Parliament, we have been seeing an owl in this House since morning but in the tradition of people of Dodoma, an owl that is seen during daytime cannot have any effect on anyone.
This means that we have nothing to worry about its presence.
For the critical, however, there is nothing pragmatic about the new act.

Spread love, not hate is the mantra that rang out during Guyana's first gay pride parade, which took place on June 3, 2018.
It was an event that allowed the country's LGBT community the opportunity to step out of the cloak of invisibility and claim their right to be proud of who they are and who they choose to love:
Spread love, not hate
Congratulations on your first-ever Pride parade, Guyana!

The festivities kicked off at the Square of the Revolution in the capital city of Georgetown, with participants wearing rainbow coloured garb and dancing to soca music as they marched in solidarity against hate and bigotry:

Anal sex (commonly known as buggery in many Caribbean territories) is still illegal in Guyana, despite the landmark rulings in the Caleb Orozco case in Belize in 2016, and the more recent Jason Jones case in Trinidad and Tobago, both of which deemed the criminalisation of sodomy unconstitutional.
Both cases were not without controversy and negative reactions, region-wide  and neither was Guyanas gay pride parade.
Netizens were quite vocal about their opposing views.
In once Facebook thread, Yolanda Adams left a scathing comment that reflected just how much of a role religion plays in the issue:
Mr President stand your ground, if you only promote this act, the country will be curse[d] because God is totally against it.
He has destroy[ed] a nation already because of this act and hasn't changed.
These are not the days to please mankind, your first duty is to protect the inncocent (sic) children.
Because if you don't you will answer to God.
So don't make decisions on Votes, God put you there not man.
So please put God first.
Shanna Leaona Patterson was also against the revocation of the law:
This government stands a better chance if they legalize small quantities of marijuana instead of antimen so they had better choose wisely
The Guyanese term for a male homosexual is an anti-man.
Facebook user Brenda Oliver had this to say:
People just trying a thing that will not pass in Guyana.
Guyana is not America
Other Facebook users thought the event was a blatant contradiction of the country's laws, and there was a lot of discussion about religious damnation.
One commenter suggested that the country had other issues to resolve  race relations, for example  that were more pressing.
Those in support of the parade  or at least those reserving judgement  appeared to be in the minority.
For Guyana's LGBT community, however, the event was a first step against the marginalisation they face because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.
Member of Parliament Priya Manickchand, who supports the communitys efforts, said that people should be able to make their own choices, and that the government had no place in people's bedrooms.
Her statements attracted online support.
Facebook user Shannon Andre Persaud wrote:
I really cant tolerate people against the LBGTQ community.
What a tremendous step it was to see this embraced in Guyana but not of course without the ignorant trolls.
But instead of engaging with discriminative and uneducated people, I unfriended and problem solved!
Love is love  And this world could do with less hatred and discrimination and lots more love and humanity.
#isupportthelbgtqcommunity
There was also some advocacy on Twitter:
One to go!
#Guyana is the only South American country where homosexuality is still illegal.
It just held its first LGBT Pride parade.
Let's hope decriminalisation is next: https://t.co/KinMuV8YK6 Congratulations to @SASODGuyana @GuyanaTrans & Guyana Rainbow Foundation.

The parade is just one facet of the communitys fight for equal rights.
Joel Simpson, managing director of the Society Against Sexual Orientation and Discrimination (SASOD) who organised the parade, had a message for government officials  the LGBT community expects to see action.
However, there is strong resistance.
At a conference the day before the gay pride parade, members of the Georgetown Ministers Fellowship expressed their displeasure by threatening to withhold their votes during elections.
The Christian community comprises more than 60% of Guyana's population and, as is the case in other regional territories, is lobbying against overturning age-old buggery laws.
The Fellowship even threatened to block the parade, but with a strong police presence, there were no incidents.
Simpson, who attended the conference as a representative of the gay community, indicated that LGBT citizens were still waiting on a 2015 campaign promise of legislative change:
We are voting, tax paying law abiding citizens like everyone We are not asking for anything special.
We should enjoy protection from discrimination.

Daniel Elombah is the publisher of elombah.com.
According to Premium Times, the Elombahs were arrested at their home in Nnewi, in south eastern Nigeria:
Daniel Elombah was arrested around 4:30 a.m. at his home in Nnewi on New Years Day, according to his brother, Paul.
He said they gathered from the officers that his brother was detained over a recent article that was deemed critical of the Inspector-General of Police Ibrahim Idris.
Mr. Elombah was initially taken to a SARS detention facility in Anambra but was later moved to Abuja around 7:00 a.m., his brother said.
Daniel Elombah told the Committee to Protect Journalists that police cited an article published in Opinion Nigeria as the reason for the arrest.
The article, which was published on December 22, 2017 in Opinion Nigeria and was not written by either of the brothers, purported that Nigeria's Inspector General of Police was involved in an unending baggage of controversy.
In an interview with the Daily Post, Inspector General Ibrahim Idris deflected direct questions about the reasons for the Elombahs arrests, simply saying that whenever you commit an offence it is our duty to ensure that we respond.
Daniel Elombah, who resides in the UK but was visiting his family in Nigeria at the time of the arrests, is know for his critical reporting on Boko Haram and President Buhari.

[Image released on Facebook by Elombah's solicitor, Obunike Ohaegbu]Nigerian journalist Daniel Elombah and his brother, Timothy Elombah, were arrested by the Nigerian police on New Year's Day.
The journalist was released later that day and soon after was hospitalized in Abuja.
Though no official explanation was given by Elombah about his hospitalization, it seems the journalist had to receive medical attention after being handcuffed like a criminal and transported in a bus over a very bad road for 700 miles to Abuja.
During the trip, the Elombah brothers were assaulted, slapped, punched and beaten by the Nigerian Police, according to a news report from Vanguard newspaper.
Police have yet to release his brother Timothy.
On January 2, 2018, a Magistrate Court sitting in Abuja granted a warrant to extend Timothy's detention.
This would enable us carry out our preliminary investigations before filing criminal charges against him, said a police spokesperson.
Nigerian authorities should immediately release Timothy Elombah, drop legal proceedings, and allow his brother Daniel to return home, said CPJ Deputy Executive Director Robert Mahoney, in New York.
Police have no business raiding a journalist's home and locking him up just because an officer does not like something written in the press.
It's not even clear that the man they have detained had anything to do with the article they deem defamatory.
Daniel Elombah has sued Nigeria's Inspector General of Police for violating his fundamental rights in a High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
He is requesting 2 billion Naira (about USD $5.5 million) in damages for his unlawful detention.
Similarly, three solicitors based in the United Kingdom have petitioned the British MP, Lyn Brown, the Prime Minister, Theresa May and Foreign Affairs Minister Boris Johnson over the unlawful arrest of Daniel Elombah.

A Gilet Jaunes (Yellow Vests) protests in the French province of Haute-Saone in November 2018.

A rumor about the spread of French yellow vest protests to other European countries went viral on Chinese social media before Christmas.
The story emerged after French president Emmanuel Macron announced a number of concessions to address protesters grievances over economic policies.
While Macron expected calm and order be restored, the Chinese-fabricated rumor predicted the opposite.
Multiple versions of the story were spread via a number of micro-blogging accounts on Weibo and Wechat, quoting sources from a commodity wholesaler in Yiwua city well known as a wholesaling centerwho stated that their entire stock of yellow vests in stock was sold out and more orders had been coming in from European nations such as Sweden, Prague, Switzerland, etc.
The story implied that the yellow vest protests were spreading throughout the continent.
Here is one version of the story that circulated on Weibo and WeChat:
,,,,,,,,,,2016,5,,2020,,
[Yiwu Index] Yiwus research report on clothing showed that orders of yellow vests from Europe has continued to surge.
Manufacturers worked overtime to meet the demand and many traders from overseas e-commerce platforms see the movement as an excellent sales opportunity.
Chinese netizens believed that based on the Yiwu commodity index and its big data, the yellow vest movement would spread to Sweden, Czech Republic, Switzerland and Spain.
Foreign media outlets pointed out that the Yiwu Index could accurately predict international political trends.
Commodity orders from overseas market could serve as indicators of public opinion and hence could accurately predict the results of political events.
Back in 2016, based on the orders of election related t-shirts and flags, manufacturers from Yiwu had predicted Donald Trump would win the U.S. presidency five months in advance.
Observers say that textile factories in Yiwu have started receiving orders from the U.S and have begun manufacturing flags and T-shirts for Trump supporters for the 2020 presidential election.
The demand is now several times larger than orders from supporters of the Democratic Party.
Some have started to predict that Trump would be re-elected.
This shows the power of Chinas big data.
Many retweeted the news with comments such as Yiwu has become a base for predicting global trends, and take a look at Yiwus export data and you can become an analyst of global affairs.
The myth of the Yiwu index
Located in Zhejiang Province, Yiwu is the world's biggest small commodities trading hub, and one of the most popular small commodities wholesale markets in China.
Yiwu's international trade city has an Index called the Yiwu China commodity index that reflects market trends.
During the US election in 2016, the Yiwu Index became a hot topic on Chinese social media, as discussions about election-related merchandise order records in Yiwu seemed to indicate that Donald Trump was more popular than Hillary Clinton.
After the election, even state-affiliated media reported that commodity order records from Yiwu and Alibaba had predictive power, and many Chinese netizens believed that the Yiwu Index was more accurate than the U.S election polls.
Some media observers were quick to point out that this interpretation was problematic, as Clinton, in fact, received more votes than Trump, but this analysis was ignored.
This time, state-affiliated media outlet Global Times fact-checked the online story and reported that yellow vests were not out of stock in the trading city and that the sales volume in recent months was not higher than last year's.
The Global Times report, however, has done nothing to stop the spread of the Yiwu Index myth.
In fact, new commentary emerged after the Christmas reasserting the predictive power of Yiwu Index.
The story, republished on various online media platforms, did acknowledge the erroneous sales figures for yellow vests, but continued to insist that the Yiwu Index had successfully predicted the results of both the 2016 U.S presidential election and the 2018 World Cup.
The writer echoed Chinese president Xi Jinping's December 18 speech on the 40th anniversary of the country's reform and opening-up, which cited Yiwu as a successful example of that shift.
The commentary concluded that the predictive power of the Yiwu Index reflects the glorious history of the country's transformation:
40
The reason Yiwu can accurately predict the trend of global affairs again and again is due to the Yiwu peoples contributions in the past few decades.
They have walked a distinctive path in the worlds commodity markets and established the citys leading status as the manufacturing hub of worlds daily necessities.
Open door and reform policy has helped numerous cities like Yiwu to take courageous steps and strike out for success.
Their efforts have brought about the great transformation of China in just 40 years.
This intertwining of the predictive power of the Yiwu Index with China's economic transformation has made the myth even more difficult to debunk.

Students eating breakfast at school.

With the acute lack of resources caused by the war in Yemen, a growing number of families are forced but to take their children out of school.
Girls are often sent away to marry at ages as young as 13.
However, one school in the capital Sana'a found a modest, yet effective, form of relief.
The NGO Solidarios sin Fronteras (based in Spain and Yemen) run almost entirely by volunteers and funded primarily by individual donations  some as small as one euro per month, has started to provide a complete breakfast for this school's girl students, who are aged six to 16.
Before the project began, one-fifth of them had been absent.
Little by little, they started to come back and, since September 2018, all 525 students are regularly attending classes, Solidarios founders say.
I've spoken via Whatsapp with two of the NGO's founders, Eva, who I had previously met in person some years ago in Barcelona, and Faten, who is in Yemen.
They told me about how their project Breakfasts to educate and protect came about.
They also asked me to not disclose their full names or the name of the school for security concerns.
In March, 2018, one of the school's teachers reached out to Faten about an 8-year-old girl who seemed to grow thinner and more exhausted by the day.
Suddenly, she stopped attending school.
She had not been the first to quit, but she was the youngest.
The teacher talked to the family: they were in extreme financial need and had received offers to marry their daughter.
When speaking with Faten, the teacher wondered whether a daily food ration could motivate families to keep their daughters in school.
And the idea was born.
Faten says:
Most of [these girls are] daughters of workers of the textile factory, which was completely destroyed [in the bombings].
The families haven't [had any] salary for 3 years.
How could they cover food expenses?
[] The most important thing is that we're supporting them to complete their education.
Their families [are also] happy, as keeping them at school prevents them from staying at home or getting married at such a young age.
In March 2018, the United Nations declared the humanitarian crisis in Yemen the worst in the world.
With raging unemployment and inflation, 80 percent of the country's families are in debt and 65 percent struggle to buy food.

Solidarios sin Fronteras consulted with a pediatrician to design the breakfast's menu.
Faten shops for groceries every morning and a married couple uses her kitchen to prepare, pack and transport the food.
During a 45-minute break at work, she rushes to the school to help the teachers distribute the meals.
Sometimes, her siblings come to help out, too.
This do-it-yourself spirit is true for the organization's three other programs.
With Food aid for families, they distribute food packages for vulnerable families in the cities of Sanaa, Aden, Amran, Raydah, Hodeidah, Al Dorihimi, and displaced families from Taiz.
Water for Yemen maintains water reservoirs in the Amran and Raydah camps for internally displaced persons and Rebuilding Socotra provides cement for rebuilding houses and dig wells in the island of Socotra, devastated by hurricanes in 2015.
What if we do it ourselves?
Prepared breakfasts are distributed every morning at the school.

It was on a trip to Yemen Eva took in 2012 that she met Faten.
Eva was watching a birthday party at the next table at a cafe in Sana'a and the birthday girl offered her cake.
The girl was Faten.
They became friends and have seen each other several times since, most recently in 2015, on Eva's latest trip to Sana'a.
Faten remembers:
A few weeks after the war began, I was on WhatsApp (as usual) and I asked Eva, can we do something to help?.
She answered that she would look for an organization in Spain with her friend Noèlia, and I was to look for one here in Yemen.
Eva, who has 15 years of experience in international development, could not find any grassroots NGO working in Yemen that she could trust.
So she and Faten, along with a third friend Noèlia, decided to create their own that same year.
The three women are a volunteer executive team and count with support from trusted volunteers in both countries.
Eva and Noèlia, who are based in Spain, take care of fundraising: they rely on social media, radio, the print press and lectures to spread the word about their work and attract contributors.
Most people donate online and SSF crowdfunds each project separately.
Faten is responsible for administering the ground operations  often from her own house.
The three of them make up the executive team and juggle their tasks in the NGO with their daily jobs.
They regularly share photographs, videos, and detailed updates on the SSF's social media pages.
They also circulate content to raise awareness about the war in Yemen, in particular, the role of Spain and other countries who supply arms used in the conflict.
